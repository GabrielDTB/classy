  "name": "Creating Musical Arrangements Using Studio Technologies",
  "description": "This course is a multi-layered content creation class where each week a different element of song composition, song structure, musical arrangement and audio production techniques will be explored. Teams will be created every three weeks where the students collectively compose an original song. Critical listening sessions of hit making records will provide insight into arrangement techniques used to support the underlying song narrative. The student will develop skills in the use of the studio as a musical instrument to create musical arrangements. Students will maintain a design journal documenting the iterative process used in music creation. They will also note differences in collaborative team dynamics from project to project. Each student will complete the course with three original portfolio projects.",
