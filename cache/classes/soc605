  "name": "Introduction to Service -Oriented Computing",
  "description": "This is an introduction to the field of service-oriented computing, in the context of a first course in computer programming, for students with no prior experience. Students will learn the core process of programming: given a problem statement, how does one design an algorithm to solve that particular problem and then implement the algorithm in a computer program? The course will also introduce elementary programming concepts like basic control concepts (such as conditional statements and loops) and a few essential data types. The notions of objects and object creation will also be introduced. The course will involve programming assignments using a self-contained user-friendly programming environment.",
