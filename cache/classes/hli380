  "description": "Utilizing Che Guevaraâ€™s journeys from The Motorcycle Diaries and from later in his life as its spine, this course surveys post-1945 Latin American literature. The emphasis will be placed on works that explore issues of poverty, oppression, and disenfranchisement. The course will further explore specific genres of fiction such as magical realism and examine how they came to evolve in Latin America. The course could include such writers as Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Pablo Neruda, and Guillermo Cabrera Infante.",
