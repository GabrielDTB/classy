  "name": "Simulation-Based Costing and Acquisition",
  "description": "This course will provide an understanding of both the tools and models that can be used throughout the design, development, and support phases of a system to conduct trade-offs between system performance and life-cycle cost. The students will be exposed to the cost benefit analysis process as a strategic tool during system design and development consistent with the principles of Cost as an Independent Variable (CAIV). The students will also be exposed to the formulation of cost-estimating relationships in this context. The course will focus on the use of tools and the development of models from case studies.",
