  "description": "This course treats friction, wear and lubrication of metals, ceramics and polymers in terms of the mechanical and chemical properties of the materials. The mechanical properties determine contact mechanics, friction forces and wear due to plastic deformation and microfracture.The chemical properties of materials determine the response of triboelements to the environment and to lubricants. New developments in synthetic lubricants and novel schemes to reduce friction and wear in extreme environments are discussed primarily via the current literature. Alternate years.",
