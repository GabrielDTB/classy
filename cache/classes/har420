  "description": "Video III is a projects-centered class for advanced students who have already built up technical skill, historical knowledge and formal vocabularies in the video medium through their earlier studies, and are now motivated to produce more intensive video projects of their own design. Video III will build on the skills and concepts introduced in Video I and II, giving students the opportunity to explore the theory, history and practice of video as a time-based art medium in more depth through screenings of artists’ work and reading of artists’ texts. Video III will also give students the opportunity to develop projects with more formal and technical complexity through technical lectures in special topics in advanced production and post- production, focused around issues relevant to the interests of students enrolled in the course—for example, surround sound mixing, interactive authoring or multi-channel editing.",
