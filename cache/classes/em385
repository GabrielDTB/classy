  "description": "This project-based course addresses the fundamentals of systems engineering. Principles and concepts of systems engineering within a life-cycle perspective are presented through case studies and applied throughout the course to a student-selected team project. The initial focus is on the understanding of business drivers for systems engineering and the generation of innovative ideas. Students then engage in analysis, synthesis, and evaluation activities as they progress through the conceptual and preliminary design phases. Emphasis is placed on tools and methodologies for system evaluation during all phases of the design process with the goal of enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of deployed systems as well as reducing operational and support costs.
