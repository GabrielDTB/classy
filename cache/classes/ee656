  "description": "The course emphasizes two main themes. The first is the study of wavelets as a newly emerging tool in signal analysis. The second is its applications in image processing and computer vision. In the first category, the following topics will be covered. Time-frequency localization, windowed Fourier transform, continuous and discrete wavelet transforms, orthogonal and biorthogonal families of wavelets, multiresolution analysis and its relation to subband coding schemes; use of wavelets in analysis of singularities. In the second category, applications of wavelets in problems of compact coding of images, edge and boundary detection, zero-crossing based representation, motion estimation and other problems relevant to image processing and transmission will be considered.",
