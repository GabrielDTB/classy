  "description": "This course examines the journey Ireland has taken from British colony to what Fintan Oâ€™Toole describes as an island unmoored. Students will explore the complex nature of political, religious, and cultural forces found in the assigned works. Historically, literature is particularly important in the context of Irish nationalism as it served as a means for crafting an identity independent of a British one. Irish authors also contributed greatly to both the Modernist and Post-Modernist movements, and the course will provide a strong foundation in those practices.",
