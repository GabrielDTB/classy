  "description": "The Design and Systems Thinking course introduces the first-year engineering students to the elementsof design and system synthesis. Students learn to use a computer aided design software to designdigitally. The course will introduce design of physical components and learn to integrate simple roboticsystems with mechanical, sensing, actuation, and micro-processor hardware components and control and communications software components. The course will prepare students to function effectively both as a team member and in the role of a leader. Through a series of self-directed modules, the course introduces engineering disciplines and several personal and professional strategies.",
