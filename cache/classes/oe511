  "description": "This course introduces the fundamental principles of urban oceanography by providing a broad overview of all the interacting processes that shape urban ocean ecosystems. The course investigates the geologic history of many urban area waters, in addition to the physics, chemistry, and biology of the waters, while emphasizing how man has significantly influenced how these systems behave. The course includes studying the local waters that surround us, such as the New York-New Jersey Estuary, the Hudson River and the East River. Via field expeditions on an Institute research vessel, students will experience first hand field sampling, data reduction and analysis of field data, and interpretation of processes. Their investigation results will be prepared as a cooperative class report.",
