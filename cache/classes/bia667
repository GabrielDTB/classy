  "description": "This course introduces fundamentals of deep learning with a focus on business applications to students in the School of Business, who, mostly, are beginners of this field. It starts with basic constructs of neural networks and progresses into widely used models including convolutional neural networks, recurrent networks, generative models, and reinforcement learning. Extensive hands-on experiments are provided in class or as assignments for students to practice each model, understand its applicable scenarios, and build practical skills. In addition, various successful deep learning business applications will be studied in this class. Moreover, the potential implications and risks of applying deep learning in the business world will be discussed, and relevant techniques to address such issues will be provided. The objective of this course is to provide students the fundamental concepts of deep learning and to build studentsâ€™ practical skills of applying deep learning to solve real business problems. Prerequisite course required MIS 637 or equivalent and BIA 660",
