  "title": "Environmental Ethics",
  "description": "This course is an in depth overview of various debates in environmental ethics. We will consider the way in which ethical theories inform environmental decision-making in a number of situations including a selection of the following: the conservation of biodiversity, global climate change, human population growth, animal exploitation in agriculture, air and water pollution, and urban solid waste. Questions addressed include the following: Should we be concerned about the impact of human life on the environment? To what extent should sacrifices be made in order to protect the environment? Which ethical frameworks are most effective in resolving disputes? To what extent are solutions based purely on economic concerns inadequate? Special attention will be given to the ways in which traditional ethical theories must be amended in order to address environmental concerns.",
