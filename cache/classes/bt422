  "description": "The objective is to acquaint you with the research and principles of judgment and decision making. Most of the material covered is about understanding and improving the judgment and decision making processes of managers and other professionals. Understanding decision making involves examining how decision makers think about difficult problems and characterizing the limitations of human decision making ability. By understanding how decisions are made, we can provide guidelines and techniques for overcoming limitations and improving the quality of decision making. This includes understanding statistically- based decision making, the psychological aspects of decision making and rational approaches to decision making. The courseâ€™s goal is to provide insights and tools that will enable you to support and improve your own decision making, to understand the decision making of others, and to enhance the decision quality of team and groups that you lead.",
