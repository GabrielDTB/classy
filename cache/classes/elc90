  "description": "ELC 90 is designed to help students position themselves as successful members of Stevens graduate community through an improved understanding of academic conventions. By resolving questions of rhetoric and language through text analysis and class discussions, students become more critical readers and effective writers. Additionally, refining the use of stylistic tools, such as structure, syntax, and vocabulary, will result in clearer and more precise written and verbal communication. Through a variety of task-based activities, such as email writing, Problem-Solution and Process writing, data commentary, and summary writing, the ELC 90 student will have the opportunity to improve the communication of both sourced and non-sourced information. Students will also refine critical elements of pronunciation by giving formal and informal presentations.",
