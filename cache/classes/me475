  "description": "This course integrates material from across the mechanical engineering curriculum. Students willbe tasked with solving open-ended, systems-level problems from a range of mechanicalengineering fields. As a hands-on, laboratory based course, these problems all require applicationof principles, skills and theories of experimentation, data-acquisition, design of experiments, aswell as written and oral reporting on experimental hardware and results.",
