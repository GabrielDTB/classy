  "description": "This course outlines the problems that the operating systems need to solve (e.g., multiprogramming, device- and memory management, file management, etc.) with a sharp focus on security. The course then demonstrates the solutions to these problems in the context of the ever-evolving hardware. The course also introduces the rudimentary concepts of queuing theory and the technique of writing discrete-event simulations as the tool in both the operating systems and complex application design.",
