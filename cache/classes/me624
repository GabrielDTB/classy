  "title": "Intelligent Mechatronic Systems",
  "description": "This course spans the background, fundamental principles and elements of hardware/software required for design and prototyping intelligent mechatronic systems and fundamentals for developing knowledge-bases, tools and methods that contribute to the intelligent response of system to expected and unexpected stimuli. The course introduces hardware and software development system architectures, interfacing to the analog world with sensors, response synthesis and actuation. Model-based, learning-based and knowledge-based algorithms that enable intelligent response synthesis by the system will be studied.",
