  "name": "Thermal-Hydraulics Design of Nuclear Power Reactors",
  "description": "This course covers the application of fundamental thermal and hydraulic principles and their application to nuclear power reactor design and analysis. It assumes that the student has a basic knowledge of fundamental principles in fluid mechanics, thermodynamics and heat transfer. Topics include: principal characteristics of nuclear power reactors; thermal design principles and application; transport equations for single-phase and two-phase flow; thermodynamics of nuclear power plant systems (steady and unsteady flow); thermal analysis of fuel elements; single-phase and two-phase flow and heat transfer; pool and flow boiling; single heated channel steady-state analysis. Major industry software including PCTRAN and TRNSYS are utilized in case studies and design projects.",
