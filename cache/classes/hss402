  "description": "This seminar course examines the psychology behind our media consumption and its impact on our political behavior and attitudes. The political landscape in the United States is increasingly polarized, including both the media environment and the mass public. In what ways do our psychological similarities and differences influence our preference for particular styles of communication? Research shows that the psychology of the left and the right favor different styles of political media. Specific topics covered include: the history of political (and partisan) media, psychological theories of media consumption, biological foundations of political attitudes and behavior, the role of the media environment and choice, partisan polarization, and the impacts of media psychology on political behavior.",
