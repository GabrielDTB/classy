In addition to lectures on technology policy and ethics, exercises will aim at developing skills to work on the interface between technology and societal/ethical issues. Case studies and group projects that illustrate issues involving multiple stakeholders with different value structures, high levels of uncertainty, multiple levels of complexity and value trade-offs that are characteristic of science and technology policy and ethics problems will be used to illustrate the inherent complexities of the problem landscape.",
