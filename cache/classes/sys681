  "title": "Dynamic Modeling of Systems and Enterprise",
  "description": "The course introduces students to fundamentals of system dynamics modeling of complex systems and enterprises. System Dynamics is a modeling approach that has been developed at MIT in the 1960s. System dynamics is used for variety of applications ranging from supply chain management, decision analysis, innovation diffusion and management and other management as well as engineering applications of complex systems. This course we will cover the basic fundamentals of systems dynamics and enable students to learn and build system dynamic models including causal links and loop diagrams, stock and flows with application to modeling contagion in systems, innovation diffusion, delays in complex systems and many more examples and applications.",
