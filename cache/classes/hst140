  "description": "In this course, students will be introduced to the topic of failure at the individual, social, and institutional levels. We will examine the concept of failure through a variety of different frameworks and disciplinary lenses – historical, philosophical, cultural, economic, scientific, political, and psychological – paying attention not only to how failure comes to be defined and delineated, but how failures are perceived, experienced, and enacted by different social groups in different settings and in different times. The course aims to normalize failure and provide students with both a conceptual and practical toolkit for coping with failure. The goal is for students to develop greater resiliency in the face of failure – both personally and professionally.",
