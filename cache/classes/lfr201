  "description": "The third course of the four-course series continues the study of the four communicative skills (reading, writing, listening, speaking). Students will enrich their vocabulary and learn more advanced grammar combining past tense forms to tell complex stories, give commands, and express doubt. Students will have more opportunities to use the language for real- world purposes. Students will encounter literature from France and the French-speaking world, and further discover popular culture through communicative multimedia videos, French news websites, and class discussions. The course will be conducted entirely in French.",
