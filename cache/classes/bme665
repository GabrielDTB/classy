  "name": "Pathophysiology",
  "description": "Pathophysiology describes changes in physiology resulting in disease or injury. A solid understanding of normal physiology is necessary before attempting the study of abnormal situations. The course emphasizes the \"mechanistic\" approach to pathophysiology, i.e., A-B-C, rather that the symptom-diagnosis-treatment approach. Multiple examples, case studies and procedural videos are presented with a discussion of what they do well and where improvements can be made.",
