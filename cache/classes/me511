  "name": "Wind Energy-Theory & Application",
  "description": "This course provides the fundamentals of the conversion of wind energy to electricity and describes the effective use of wind energy for a variety of applications. It spans a wide range of fields, from meteorology through mechanical, electrical, structural engineering and aerodynamics, to economics and environmental concerns. Topics include wind energy principles, wind site assessment, wind turbine components, wind power generation machinery, economics of wind energy, environmental concerns and the future of wind power. These topics are covered in sufficient detail for everyones understanding without requiring prior background in all these disciplines. Using the knowledge gained from the course, the students are expected to complete a class project designing a small scale wind energy.",
