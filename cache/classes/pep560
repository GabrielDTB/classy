  "description": "This course exposes the student to the physical principles underlying remote sensing of ocean, atmosphere, and land by electromagnetic and acoustic passive and active sensors: radars, lidars, infrared and microwaves thermal sensors, sonars, sodars, infrasound/seismic detectors. Topics include fundamental concepts of electromagnetic and acoustic wave interactions with oceanic, atmospheric, and land environment, as well as with natural and man-made objects. Examples from selected sensors will be used to illustrate the information extraction process, and applications of the data for environmental monitoring, oceanography, meteorology, and security/military objectives.",
