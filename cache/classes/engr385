The course is primarily project- based with relevant lectures and seminars from the instructor and guest speakers. Each student or group of students will develop a plan of project activities appropriate for the assigned credits under the supervision of an advisor and may include a co-advisor from outside Stevens. The scope of the project must not duplicate any activity for which credit has been or is being obtained in another course.
