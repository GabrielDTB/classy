Recording Studio design will be explored and the mysteries of the room \"appearance\" will be explained. The more informed an individual is about the topic of acoustics; the art of music production becomes more efficiently achieved. The student will complete the course with a thorough understanding of acoustical design techniques. This knowledge will not only prepare the student for professional studio design and construction (music, audio/video for post production), it is also applicable in understanding the environments in which they might create productions.",
