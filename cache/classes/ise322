  "description": "This course provides students with experiences and tools for new product and process development. Students will become familiar with systematic approaches to design, and they will explore the design process from problem identification through detailed design, validation, and economic analysis. Tools that have been introduced in earlier industrial and systems engineering courses may be brought together as part of this pre-senior design experience. Discussions of contemporary design issues and class projects will provide experiences and insights that will serve to improve their senior project experience.",
