  "title": "The Art of Structural Engineering",
  "description": "At its best, creativity in structural engineering leads to forms that are notable for their sculptural and aesthetic quality as much as for their structural intelligence. Structures that express this behavior clearly and elegantly achieve the highest levels of artistic creation, and become cultural symbols that exceed historical and cultural boundaries. This course explores Art in Structural Engineering as it evolves in modern history, beginning with the Cast Iron bridges of the Industrial Revolution. It progresses through the works of Eiffel, Roebling, Freyssinet, and Maillart to modern day innovators like Menn, Khan, and Calatrava. Students learn engineering concepts through technical presentations on structural landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, Guggenheim Museum, George Washington Bridge, and the Hearst Tower. The course studies beautiful works of structural art and takes site visits in the metropolitan area to supplement the classroom material. These trips will include the Brooklyn Bridge, Skyscraper Museum, Cast Iron District, Flatiron Building, Guggenheim Museum, and Hearst Building. The course converges engineering, architecture, design, and art into one distinguished field. It teaches the concepts and designs behind structural engineering, so high a quality in imaginative conception and execution, that the engineering itself takes on the aspects of art.",
