  "description": "Over the past two decades, there has been a rise in wetland mitigation projects across the country. The success of a wetland depends mainly on it hydrology. Central to the course will be the principle of water budgeting. This course will outline the hydrologic principles involved in freshwater and coastal wetland engineering. Dynamic and steady state mathematical modeling will be presented as techniques to estimate wetland hydrology.",
