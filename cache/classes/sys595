  "description": "This course is an application oriented with theoretical arguments approached from an intuitive level rather than from a rigorous mathematical approach. This course teaches the student how statistical analyses are performed while assuring the student an understanding of the basic mathematical concepts. The course will focus on \"real world\" uses of statistical analysis and reliability theory. The student will use the software to solve problems. Included in this course will demonstrate Markov modeling techniques. This course is a perquisite to the System Reliability and Life Cycle Analysis course.",
