  "description": "This course dispels the myths about writing for the web and provides students with the skills to move successfully from print to web. The dynamic medium of the Internet not only demands concise, clear, well-organized copy, but an ability to operate in a non-linear world. This course will enable students to: reinforce good technical writing practices; incorporate usability issues when designing information for the web; think in non-linear ways; recognize the different functions of web copy and how to write for each (educational, promotional, information-seeking); understand the different delivery methods and how they influence the layout of the information and audio-visual choices.",
