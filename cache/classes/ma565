  "description": "The course provides an introduction to the theory and practice of quantum computation. It starts with a brief and abstract introduction to quantum mechanics, introduces quantum gates and quantum circuits. Then it concentrates on different quantum algorithms (Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, Simons algorithm, quantum Fourier transforms, Shors integer factorization and discrete logarithm algorithms, Grovers search algorithm) and demonstrates their advantage over classic counterparts. Finally, it gives a short introduction to quantum information theory, quantum communication complexity, and quantum cryptography.",
