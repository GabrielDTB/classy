  "description": "This course is an introduction to the field of Tissue Engineering. It is rapidly emerging as a therapeutic approach to treating damaged or diseased tissues in the biotechnology industry. In essence, new and functional living tissue can be fabricated using living cells combined with a scaffolding material to guide tissue development. Such scaffolds can be synthetic, natural, or a combination of both. This course will cover the advances in the field of cell biology, molecular biology, material science and their relationship towards developing novel ‘tissue engineered’ materials.",
