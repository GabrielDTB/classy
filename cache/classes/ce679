  "description": "An introduction to the applied nonlinear regression, multiple regression and time-series methods for modeling civil and environmental engineering processes. Topics include: coefficient estimation of linear and nonlinear models; construction of multivariate transfer function models; modeling of linear and nonlinear systems; forecast and prediction using multiple regression and time series models; statistical quality control techniques; ANOVA tables and analysis of model residuals. Applications include monitoring and control of wastewater treatment plants, hydrologic-climatic histories of watercourses, and curve-fitting of experimental and field data.",
