  "description": "Development of the fundamental equations of finite-element theory, using the matrix displacement approach. Detailed case studies of one-dimensional (truss and beam), two-dimensional (plane stress/strain and axisymmetric solid), k and plate-bending elements are explained. Applications include interactive model building and solutions.",
