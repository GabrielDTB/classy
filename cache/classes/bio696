  "description": "This course will provide laboratory experience to learn about biochemical protein enzymology and protein structure for those students who are pursuing a career in biotechnology, pharmaceutical sciences or basic protein research. Students will learn state-of-the-art research techniques and strategies for determining enzyme kinetics and the mechanism of action of drugs used in drug discovery. Some technique examples include: 1.) using a 384 well fluorescence and absorbance plate reader to calculate the inhibition potency (Kd) of drugs designed to inhibit the function of enzymes and 2.) determining the structure and stability of proteins bound to drugs using circular dichroism spectroscopy. The practical lab experience learned from this course will enable the student to enter directly into a research environment as found in biotechnology.",
