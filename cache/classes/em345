  "description": "This course emphasizes building analytical skills for developing mathematical models and running computer simulations for decision-making. The course provides an introduction to modeling and simulations concepts and analysis techniques for mathematical programming and decision making. Basic computers skills and knowledge of statistics are necessary to solve the problems discussed in the lectures and any assigned for homework. The course emphasis is on problem formulation, model building, data analysis, solution techniques, and evaluation of alternative designs/processes in complex systems. Modeling and simulations techniques and methods for decision analysis in this course will investigate discrete event modeling, and agent-based modeling in depth.",
