  "name": "Creative Writing",
  "description": "Creative Writing is a beginnerâ€™s workshop in the creation of poetry and fiction. Students examine issues such as narrative structure, stanza forms, free verse, and so on. The course explores distinctions between writing as a craft and writing as a process more closely allied with prophecy and gnosis. The impact of the computer on writing is examined. Students read works on poetics and theories of fiction, in particular mimetic and expressionistic theories developed in the West, and learn to shape their own work accordingly. Brief writing assignments are assigned weekly with a longer writing project developed over the part of the course and due the final day of class.",
