Some of the topics covered include: hardware configuration, operating system installation, shell programming, security policies, back-up deployment and disaster recovery, network design, software installation and maintenance, operating system tuning, and best practices for problem determination. Security topics including packet sniffers and spoofers, buffer overflow attacks and stack protection, and firewalls and intrusion detection are also covered, with an emphasis on their implementation.
