  "description": "This course introduces students to the discipline of literature by examining literary works of different genres that focus on science and scientific inquiry. Special attention is given to the ways that scientific advances have challenged conventional beliefs about the structure of the world and humanityâ€™s place in it. The course will examine how, throughout the centuries, science has been considered as a source for liberation and innovation on the one hand or oppression and even possible transgression on the other. Readings may include works by Aeschylus (Prometheus Bound), Marlowe (Doctor Faustus), Blake, Brecht, Stoppard, Vonnegut, and others.",
