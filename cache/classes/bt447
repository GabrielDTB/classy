  "description": "This course is about creativity and innovation, which are now the main sources of competitive advantage in many industries. Many firms now rely on products developed within the prior three to five years for a large portion of their revenues and profits. In this course, we will explore such key topics as the industry dynamics of technological innovation, the formulation of technological innovation strategy, and the implementation of technological innovation strategy. We will strive to go beyond simply learning concepts, although understanding major concepts is of critical importance to the management of technology and innovation. Throughout the course, key conceptual frameworks will be linked to applications in a variety of organizational and industrial settings.",
