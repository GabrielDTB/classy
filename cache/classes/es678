  "description": "Real-time responsiveness characterizes systems at the forefront of competition, enterprise, strategy, warfare, governance, innovation, engineering, development, information, integration, and virtually anything designed today for purpose. This course covers fundamental objectives, performance metrics, analysis frameworks, and design principles for engineering agile and resilient systems. Real examples are analyzed in case studies for their change proficiency and response ability. Response capability frameworks are applied in analysis and requirements development. Architecture and design principles which enable resilient and innovative response are illuminated and then applied in synthesis exercises. Hands-on, minds-on exercises prepare and guide the participant in applying the knowledge. Systems for case study and focus can run the range from products and processes to governance and infrastructure to enterprises and systems-of-systems.",
