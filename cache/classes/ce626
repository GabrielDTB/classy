  "description": "A new approach to the overall earthquake-engineering problem is presented in a form that may be utilized by engineering design offices. New earthquake invariants are obtained. The emphasis is placed on the two major topics (1) damage assessment and (2) structural design, but some consideration is also given to the development of a new \"mechanism\" theory consistent with deep-foci earthquakes. The fundamental data bases the sources for the basic hypotheses and the resultant theories are the accelerograms and the isoseismal maps. These lead to temporal and space wise energy variations that are the key elements in the theoretical approach.",
