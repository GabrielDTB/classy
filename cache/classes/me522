  "description": "This course introduces principles of mechatronics to integrate mechanical, electronic/electrical, and control/computer/ software components for motion control systems. Electromechanical components and integration concepts include: machine construction and control concepts, control modes (open/closed loop, servo, and process control) and motion profiles, motion drivers and actuators (AC drives, motors, gearing, servo and stepper motors), PLC control and programming (ladder and Boolean and combinatorial logic interfaces), microprocessor/computer based (logic, operating systems, SCADA, and HMI), field devices, signal conditioning, and communication (I/O hardware and management, vision systems, protocols, and programming languages), and introduction to system integration. Course includes hands-on lab work, small design projects, case studies, and industry guest lectures.",
