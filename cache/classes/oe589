  "description": "An introductory course covering the fundamental principles of coastal engineering. The initial stages of the course are intended to provide an understanding of the physics of the coastal environment. Topics will include basic wave theory (wave generation, refraction, diffraction, and shoaling), wave prediction techniques, tides and coastal circulatio, and sediment transport. The latter stages of the course will be devoted to the application of these basic principles, such as stabilization and harbor development. The course will culminate in a substantial design project, which will incorporate all aspects of the course material, ranging from the estimation of design wave conditions to the actual design of a shore protection structure.",
