  "name": "Creative Problem Solving and Team Programming",
  "description": "Gives students practice in solving challenging problems by applying algorithmic problem solving techniques learned in prior courses. Students will develop their problem-solving, algorithm-creation, and programming abilities. Problems will be complex and will require invention of an algorithm, not simply straightforward application of standard techniques. Students will work in teams. To provide a focus point and to help make the course fun, students will program their solutions in a style similar to that employed by programming competitions such as the national ACM programming contest. May be repeated for credit.",
