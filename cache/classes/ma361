  "title": "Partial Differential Equations",
  "description": "This course offers a rigorous approach to classical partial differential equations. It begins with definitions, properties, and derivations of some basic equations of mathematical physics followed by the topics: solving of first order equations with the method of characteristics; classification of second order equations; the heat equation and wave equation; Fourier series and separation of variables; Greenâ€™s functions and elliptic theory; examples of the first and second order nonlinear partial differential equations.",
