  "description": "This course teaches a deep knowledge of C++ by focusing on common engineering problems. The focus is on engineering applications. In the beginning, the course covers computational goals to including statistics, smoothing data, numerical integration and calculation of volumes to teach/review basic programming logic, loops and function calls. Then we focus on more complex tasks such as simulation, localization and path planning for robotics, and teach object-oriented programming as part of an efficient solution to these engineering problems. By the end of the course, students will have a thorough knowledge of C++.",
