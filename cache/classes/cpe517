  "name": "Digital and Computer Systems Architecture",
  "description": "This course covers the design and architecture of computer and digital systems in the system design region starting from the transistor/logic gate level to below the device driver level/system monitor level. The systems considered in the course will go beyond the computer chips or CPUs discussed in a typical computer architecture course, but will include complex logic devices such as application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), the core-designs for field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), system-on-a-chip (SoC) designs, ARM, and other application-specific architectures. Printed circuit board-level architectural considerations for multiple complex digital circuits will also be discussed.",
