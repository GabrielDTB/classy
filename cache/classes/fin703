  "description": "This course is designed to provide Ph.D. students of the Business Administration track (and also some other disciplines) with a rigorous foundation in modern microeconomics theory. The course covers the majority of standard PhD-level microeconomics topics; however, a few topics have been modified in a way to maximize the benefits to students in various areas of the business administration. Following that strategy, we will have a lighter emphasizes on pure theoretical aspects of topics and will spend more time with applied model-building skills as well as fundamental concepts of advanced microeconomics.",
