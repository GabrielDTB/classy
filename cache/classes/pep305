  "description": "Simple physics can be used to analyze the biological systems on the vastly different scales ranging from the cell organelles to the entire ecosystems. We will study the laws of physics in biological context and the limits of their applicability, i.e. the interplay of physical simplifications and biological complexities. We will also study the effect of geological and astronomical phenomena on biological systems. The course has a 'discovery' project component with statistical analysis of the biological data collected in image analysis, field studies, and computer simulations.",
