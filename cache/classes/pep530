  "description": "This course introduces students to the fundamental principles of physical science and develops in them a deeper understanding of the key issues in global energy production and consumption and global scale change and the engineering of solutions to the problems arising from these phenomena. The concepts of energy and energy transformations will be at the core of this course. These will be introduced using simple mechanical systems such as the pendulum and then will be generalized to discuss phenomena from the atomic scale to the global scale.",
