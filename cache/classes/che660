  "description": "Mathematical modeling and identification of chemical processes. State-space process representation and analysis: stability, observability, controllability and reach-ability. Analysis and design of advanced control systems: internal model control, dynamic matrix control and model predictive control. Synthesis of multivariable control systems: interaction analysis, singular value decomposition, decoupler design. Continuous and sampled-data systems, on-line process identification. State and parameter estimation techniques: Luenberger observer and Kalman filter. Knowledge of Laplace transforms, material and energy balances, computer programming and matrix algebra is required.",
