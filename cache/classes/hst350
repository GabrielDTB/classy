  "name": "Medical Anthropology",
  "description": "Medical anthropologists study the complex connections between culture, society, ecology, political economy, technology, science, disease and health. In this course, we will examine the field of biomedicine as a culture in itself, exploring and analyzing its particular languages, rituals, habits, ethics, costumes, belief systems, and customs. At the same time, we will explore the long history of medical anthropology from its beginnings within sociocultural anthropology, to the more recent development of critical medical anthropology, and finally, to work being done in the field today.",
