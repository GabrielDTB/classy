  "description": "This course highlights selected engineers in the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries who both contributed to and were influenced by their country’s politics, economy, society, or culture. Through readings, discussions, lectures, and assignments we shall see, in countries from France to the U.S. to China, how engineers helped modern nations shape the world inside and beyond their borders. This course complements HHS 465, from \"Caves to Cathedrals: Engineering Until 1500\" and \"Wind, Water & Steam: Engineering from 1400 – 1750,\"but none of these courses is a prerequisite for any of the others.",
