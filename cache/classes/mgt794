Additionally, the equipment/system selection process will use the techniques of probabilistic outcomes, simulation, sensitivity analysis and multi-attribute analysis to better define the risks and opportunities of these investments. Also studied are telecommunications systems' effects on the balance sheet of the corporation as financial assets or liabilities; strategic assets, active revenue-producing tools or passive service provision in the corporation's realization of a business plan.",
