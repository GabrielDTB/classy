  "id": "FE 710",
  "name": "Applied Stochastic Differential Equations",
  "description": "Topics include Ito calculus review, linear stochastic differential equations (SDE’s), examples of solvable SDE’s, weak and strong solutions, existence and uniqueness of strong solutions, Ito-Taylor expansions, SDE for Markov processes with jumps, Levy processes, forward and backward equations and the Feynman-Kac representation formula, and introduction to stochastic control. Applications are mostly from financial engineering but applications in areas such as population dynamics, energy, climatology and seismology may also be presented.",
