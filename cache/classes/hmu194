  "name": "History of American Popular Music",
  "description": "This course surveys a selection of influential movements in American popular music, through the study of historically representative recordings in their social and cultural contexts. By centering the African American foundations of a variety of styles, the course aims to foster discussion and awareness of their influence over time and across communities, to develop critical listening practices, and to enhance understanding of American societal fabric through the study of music. Areas to be addressed throughout the course include the interdependency of sacred and secular contexts, and the contributions of underrepresented artists alongside more widely known figures.",
