  "description": "This year long, two-course sequence involves the students in a collaborative design experience in an area relevant to Industrial & Systems Engineering. The need for the project is taken from industry, business, government, not-for-profit organization, or a student-defined project approved by the course instructor. The need expressed by the client must lend itself to apply the knowledge, tools and methods the students are exposed to in the ISE curriculum to come up with a viable design. The teams will develop a set of alternative conceptual solutions based on deep analysis of clients’ and other stakeholder’s needs and expectations as well as gather data and knowledge from relevant sources. They will propose a preferred concept based on a thorough assessment of the alternatives. The proposed conceptual solution will be detailed further into a preliminary design by the end of the fall semester. Throughout the year, the teams will submit written reports at key milestones, and formally present it to clients, faculty, subject matter experts and peers.",
