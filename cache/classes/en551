  "name": "Environmental Chemistry of Soils and Natural Surfaces",
  "description": "Soil is a mixture of inorganic and organic solids, air, water, and microorganisms. Soil affects the environmental chemistry through the interactions at solution-solid and air-solid interfaces, and the soil in turn is affected by the environmental and human activities. Soil science is not only important to agriculture, but also to diverse fields, such as environmental engineering, biogeochemistry, and hydrology. This course will enable students to understand the chemical properties of soil, soil minerals, natural surfaces, and mechanisms regulating solute chemistry in soil solutions. The fate and transport of inorganic and organic pollutants in soil and soil remediation technologies are discussed. One year of introductory chemistry is required for students who want to take this course.",
