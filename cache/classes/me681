  "description": "The goals of this course are to go beyond the introduction stage in Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) and Nano- Electro-Mechanical Systems (NEMS) to provide students with a strong background in the design and characterization of micro- and nano-scale sensors and actuators with a broad range of applications in VNT-based sensors, actuators and devices, biomedical systems, micro- and nanoscale manipulation, adaptive optics, and microfluidics. The main focus is on the fundamental challenges and limitations involved in designing and demonstrating micro and nano devices and systems.",
