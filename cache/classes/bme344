  "name": "Biotransport Laboratory",
  "description": "Biotransport Laboratory is an introductory course that is designed to provide students with hands-on experience in principles of fluid and mass transport relevant to different biomedical applications. Transport phenomena are central to the biological processes related to molecule, cell, and tissue functions; and to design and develop biomedical devices. Accordingly, this course consists of multiple modules, each of which contains a specific experiment focused to demonstrate basic principles and methods used widely to study transport phenomena in biological systems and to create advanced biomedical devices",
