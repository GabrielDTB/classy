  "name": "The Legend of King Arthur",
  "description": "The course covers a variety of texts beginning with the earliest chronicle reports of a great battle leader—Arthur, king of Britain—and ending with high medieval romances such as The Death of King Arthur. The course explores the birth of the Arthurian legend. Was there ever a historical Arthur? Did he arise to save his people? Will he come again as legend has promised? How has his story developed in literature and popular culture? Delving into the mythic past of Europe, the readings include folk-tales and historical chronicles, and students will immerse themselves in some of earliest sword and sorcery literature, and observe along the way how developing technologies enhanced warrior cultures.",
