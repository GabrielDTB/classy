  "description": "This course will examine African-American cinema from a number of different perspectives: for its unique artistic contribution to the medium; for its nuanced portrayal of a community often marginalized and stereotyped by Hollywood; for its exploration of often forgotten aspects of American history; and for its struggles to receive adequate financial and production support. Students will consider the historical context of when the films were made as well as how they speak to the present moment.",
