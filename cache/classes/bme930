  "description": "Doctoral students in Biomedical Engineering are required to pass the qualifying examination. The process for the examination comprises the following steps: 1) submission of a written Ph.D. proposal; 2) revision of the proposal, unless the initially-submitted proposal scored highly enough for this step to be omitted; and 3) oral defense of the proposal. Students who entered the doctoral program with or without a masters degree submit the initial proposal at the start of their third or fourth term, respectively. Students have one attempt to successfully complete the qualifying examination process, which is described in greater detail on the BME intranet site: https://my.stevens.edu/ses/content/bme-phd-student-guidelines",
