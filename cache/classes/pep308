  "description": "This course is an in-depth exploration of the theory and applications of geometrical optics to the design and use of optical instrumentation. Starting with a review of reflection and refraction, students will learn increasingly sophisticated concepts involving the propagation of light rays through various optical elements, starting with individual optical surfaces through complete optical instruments. Key concepts include ray propagation, the paraxial approximation, thin and thick lenses, stops, pupils and windows, ray tracing and the application of computation tools to analyze and design optical systems.",
