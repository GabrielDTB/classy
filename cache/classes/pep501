  "description": "The course will cover the most common atomic and nuclear effects, yet covers it in direct relation to a sophisticated quantum mechanical treatment. It thereby connects the theoretical models with the experimental results, showcasing agreement as well as disagreement to outline the validity range of each model. Topics covered include Brownian motion; charge and mass of electrons and ions; Zeeman effect; photoelectric effect; emission, absorption, reflection, refraction, diffraction, absorption, and scattering of X-rays; Compton effect; diffraction of electrons; uncertainty principle; electron optics; atomic spectra and electron distribution; radioactivity; disintegration of nuclei; nuclear processes; nuclear energy; and fission.",
