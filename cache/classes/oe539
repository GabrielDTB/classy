  "name": "Introduction to Underwater Acoustics",
  "description": "The course is intended to acquaint students with environmental acoustics and the application of acoustic waves to remote environmental monitoring. Students will learn how to measure and suppress environmental noise and how underwater acoustic systems are used for remote measurements of various ocean and river parameters, including: bottom profile, surface waves, current, bubble and fish density, etc. The course also surveys recent developments in acoustic tomography, including global warming control. Students will be asked to write a research paper on the application of acquired methods to remote acoustic measurements conducted at Stevens.",
