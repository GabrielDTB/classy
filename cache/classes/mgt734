  "description": "In this graduate Ph.D. seminar, we will actively explore design science. We will read the existing literature and write our own papers. As part of this, we will run simulations and design new mechanisms and interfaces. The end result of the course will be the production of models: simulations that represent social and technical phenomena and a paper, authored individually or jointly, suitable for publication. Masters students with strong professional design experience may be admitted to the course with permission of the instructor. These students may fulfill the requirements through a final design project, appropriately documented.",
