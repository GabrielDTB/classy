  "description": "This course is designed to provide Ph.D. students of the Business Administration track (and also some other disciplines) with a rigorous foundation in modern corporate finance theory. This PhD course considers a number of topics that are at the center of ongoing research in contract theory/corporate finance. FIN 800A provides an introduction to Contract Theory (and in particular its contributions to Corporate Finance) and considers the main theoretical contributions to Corporate Finance. The class material will be divided in three parts: (i) Fundamentals of Contract Theory; (ii) The Theory of Corporate Finance and (iii) Empirical Topics on Corporate Finance. This is mostly a research-oriented course. I expect students to come up with new ideas and are able to put these ideas into models and test them empirically",
