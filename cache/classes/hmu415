  "name": "Contemporary Music Theory",
  "description": "Contemporary Music Theory is a one semester presentation of the materials and procedures of music emanating from the evolution of Romanticism through Impressionism and arriving at the dismantling of tonality in the 20th century. In this class, melodic, rhythmic and harmonic analysis will transcend the triadic structures of the common period as presented in Music Theory I-IV. Students will be expected to demonstrate their understanding of all concepts presented in class via a series of quizzes and two significant works they will compose during the course of the semester.",
