  "description": "The primary aim of this course is to introduce students to the medium of film as a possible vehicle for the presentation and examination of key philosophical concepts and ideas such as the nature of reality, time, and the question of the good life. Special consideration will be given to the ways this mode of presentation might differ from more traditional methods such as the philosophical treatise or essay. Throughout this course we will analyze classical as well as more recent films.",
