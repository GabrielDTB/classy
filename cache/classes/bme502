  "description": "The objectives of this course is to provide an engineering approach to human physiology for engineering students that have a limited background in Biology as a prerequisite for pursuing a graduate course of study in Biomedical Engineering. Part I will cover homeostasis and the two master controllers of the body, the nervous system and the endocrine system and their complementary mechanisms for maintaining homeostasis from a systems engineering point of view. Functional anatomy and physiology will be covered as well as quantitative methods for the analysis of cell signaling.",
