  "description": "This course enhances the systems security knowledge base introduced in SES 622 with project experience in security design and architecture. It covers systems security considerations in functional analysis, decomposition, and requirements processes, and teaches practical heuristics for developing secure architectures. It demonstrates how to incorporate threat and vulnerability analysis into the architecture and design process. The students execute multiple phases of a project wherein a system security strategy is proposed, designed, architected, and supplemented with operational guidelines.",
