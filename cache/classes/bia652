Students will master multivariate analysis techniques, including principal components analysis, factor analysis, structural equation modeling, multidimensional scaling, correspondence analysis, cluster analysis, multivariate analysis of variance, discriminant function analysis, logistic regression, as well as other methods used for dimension reduction, pattern recognition, classification, and forecasting. Students will build expertise in applying these techniques to real data through class exercises and a project, and learn how to visualize data and present results. This proficiency will enable students to become sophisticated data analysts, and to help make more informed design, marketing, and business decisions.",
