  "description": "This rigorous and intensive computer animation course builds upon Animation I & II. The course is designed for the serious 3-D animation student who is expecting to continue working in animation. It continues the approach of increasing skills and artistic practice in all areas of 3-D animation: concept, modeling, animation, and rendering. This is not just a software training course. While understanding advanced software tools will be necessary to attain the objectives of this course, grade evaluation is based on the studentâ€™s development and successful demonstrations of mastery of timing, visual design, and storytelling abilities. Throughout the class, students will be encouraged to find their own artistic voice. Does not fulfill general humanities requirements; may be taken as a free elective.",
