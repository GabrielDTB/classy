  "description": "An overview of soil mineralogy, soil formation, chemistry, and composition. Influence of the above factors in environmental engineering properties; study of colloidal phenomena; fate and transport of trace metals in sediments, soil fabric, and structure; conduction phenomena; and compressibility, strength, deformation properties, and stress-strain-time effects, as they pertain to environmental geotechnology applications (i.e., contaminated soil remediation, soil/solid waste stabilization, waste containment alternatives, soil-water-contaminant interactions, and contaminant transport).",
