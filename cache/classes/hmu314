  "title": "Electroacoustic Composition",
  "description": "This course will explore the historical context, methods and current research trends surrounding the composition of electroacoustic music. Students will record and shape environmental sound recordings using digital audio platforms to explore the soundscape (sonic environment) as compositional form. Through this creative process, students will explore the integration and segregation of both traditional music and environmental sound events into different musical streams based on comparative analyses of their sonic structures. The final course assignment will require students to apply new knowledge and music production skill-sets to produce their own original electroacoustic composition.",
