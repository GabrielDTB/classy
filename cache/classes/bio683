  "description": "This graduate-level course will introduce light- microscopy techniques and quantitative image analysis approaches that are commonly used in academic and industry laboratories. The objective will be achieved through a laboratory-based learning experience that integrates the theory of microscopy with hands-on tasks in cell and tissue preparation, image acquisition, and computational image analysis. The class will be divided into two parts. The first part, 10-week long, will focus on the teaching of sample preparation, image acquisition, and processing. The second part, 4-week long, will incorporate projects that students will be assigned to quantitatively examine biological processes in fixed cells or human tissues. Upon completion of this class, students will have a solid understanding of the most used quantitative imaging approaches in biological research.",
