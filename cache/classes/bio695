  "description": "This course is designed for beginning graduate students and advanced undergraduate students with a particular enthusiasm for advanced cell biology. Overall, the course will present organelle biogenesis by first presenting past scientific strategies, theories, and findings in the field of cell biology and then relating these foundations to current investigations. Reviews of protein and lipid mediators important for organelle biogenesis are then presented followed by summaries focused on the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, lysosome, mitochondria, and peroxisome. Each organelle will be extensively covered for sub-compartment biochemistry, isolation, and current research. Intensive classroom discussions focus on the experimental methods used, results obtained, interpretation of these results in the context of cell structure and function, and implications for further directions of studies in the field.",
