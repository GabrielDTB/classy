  "description": "This course will provide students with a practical approach to current computational and experimental methods used in the field of biomechanics. The goal of the course will be to bridge the gap between the theoretical computations and the practical application of experimental techniques. Topics covered will include cartilage and muscle mechanics as well as the response of bone tissue to loading. The analysis of implants will also be covered. The course will conclude with analysis of human motion. Experiments will be associated with various topics to demonstrate practical applications of the theoretical concepts introduced. Students will be required to use statistical analysis software.",
