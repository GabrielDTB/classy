  "description": "Fundamental concepts of statics including equivalent force systems, equilibrium of rigid bodies,and internal forces in trusses, frames, and machines; relationship of internal forces to stress andstrain; impact of geometry and material properties on static failure modes. Axial loading andtorsion. Students will explore and apply these concepts in the context of iterative design,analysis, and experimental testing in the associated Design Studio.
