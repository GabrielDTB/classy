  "name": "Surfzone Hydrodynamics",
  "description": "This course focuses on the identification of the physical principles and environmental phenomena responsible for driving nearshore circulation on open ocean coasts. The equations governing the hydrodynamics of the surfzone (shoreward of the break point) will be studied in detail and the various types of models used to predict nearshore circulation will be discussed. Real world examples, based on current research projects being conducted at the Stevens Coastal Engineering Research Lab will form an integral part of the curriculum. Topics covered will include: basic hydrodynamics, linear wave theory, wave transformation, wave boundary layers, surfzone currents, and nearshore circulation.",
