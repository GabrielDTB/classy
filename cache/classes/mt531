  "title": "Materials Failure Analysis",
  "description": "A study of the fundamental and engineering aspects of materials failure and its prevention with a focus on the practical approach. Discussions will include elasticity/plasticity, fracture mechanics, failure mechanisms, structural and environmental factors, laboratory analysis, and nondestructive evaluation. Examples will include cast, drawn, and joined components manufactured from various metals and nonmetallic materials. Emphasis will be on the approach to materials failure analysis with failure problems provided by the instructor and the class participants. Fall semester.",
