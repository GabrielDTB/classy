  "description": "Students are invited to learn the fundamentals of musculoskeletal rehabilitation and design and test a \"biofeedback\" device that teaches the end-user about body movement mechanics. Biofeedback is used in rehabilitation and in other movement-training paradigms to facilitate motor (re-)learning – conveying biological sensor data to the end-user either concurrently (real-time) or terminally, after the movement is complete. For example, one emerging type of real-time biofeedback uses precise musical cues to convey biomechanics metrics to help people learn movement skills. Students will work in groups to design and experimentally evaluate an audio and/or visual biofeedback device of their choosing, as they develop skills using biomechanical sensors through lab assignments and communicate their device development in an IEEE-style paper. An additional unique aspect of the course is its community engagement: students will share their designs with younger students and/or the public, which will build students’ abilities to present and teach new concepts.",
