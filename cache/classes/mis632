Specifically, students will gain hands-on experience in: (i) ERWIN - a widely used commercial tool for representing conceptual (e.g., E-R diagrams) and logical data models (e.g., relational DBMS), (ii) PostgreSQL (relational database software), (iii) SQL Structured Query Language) and (iv) MongoDB a NoSQL document data store. Students in MIS 632 must also be enrolled in the associated 2-credit lecture course MIS 631 Managing Data course.",
