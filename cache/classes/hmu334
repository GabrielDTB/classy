  "description": "As the final semester of Sound Recording Arts, students are expected to fully understand the basic principles of audio engineering and the studio environment as a workplace. This class is designed to specifically address digital audio production. Although many of the topics have been mentioned in previous classes, course work will require in depth analysis of the many elements of this production format. Additionally, we will be studying in depth, advanced audio techniques. Students will be required to bring an audio example every class to be evaluated and attempt to recreate using the studio as lab. By the end of the semester, students will understand advanced principals of digital recording and the practical application thereof. Additionally, students will have in depth experiential knowledge of recording practices and advanced production techniques. Does not fulfill general humanities requirements; may be taken as a free elective.",
