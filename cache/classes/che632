  "description": "This course introduces the principal concepts and methods of fluid mechanics. Topics include conservation of mass and momentum equations for continuum mechanics; Navier-Stokes equation for viscous flows; lubrication theory; boundary layers; circulation and vorticity theorems; potential flow; surface tension and surface tension driven flows. All discussions are accompanied by classical examples to illustrate how the concepts and methods are applied to problem solving in chemical engineering. Novel applications demonstrated in class and problems assigned for homework provide extra experience in using the covered ideas.",
