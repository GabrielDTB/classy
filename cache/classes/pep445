  "description": "Black holes, white dwarfs, and neutron stars – \"compact objects\" in astrophysics – are fundamental constituents of our Universe. This course introduces the basic physics of compact objects. First, the basic physical properties of compact objects are analyzed in their simplest states. Then, the effects of rotation, magnetic fields, and particle and (electromagnetic and gravitational) wave emissions are considered. Some of the topics to be covered include the Chandrasekhar limit, classical, magneto-, and super-fluids, pulsars, Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes, accretion disks, and gravitational waves. The students will explore the latest theoretical models and observations and solve and discuss problems to reinforce concepts encountered in lectures.",
