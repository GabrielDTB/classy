  "description": "Contemporary Culture provides an introduction to work in literature and film from 1950 to the present. Students read and view a range of works that illustrate aesthetic and cultural aspects of contemporary literature and film, including political, social, and religious matters, and the influence of technology on works by Ginsberg, Seybald, Godard, and others. The course is not intended as a survey of the principal contemporary texts and films but rather as an introduction to various key notions and modes that are characteristic of our time.",
