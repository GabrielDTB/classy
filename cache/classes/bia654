  "description": "This course covers fundamental concepts of experimentation including hypothesis development, operational definitions, reliability and validity, and measurement and variables, as well as design methods, such as sampling, randomization, and counterbalancing. The course also introduces the analysis associated with different designs as designing solid experiments involves thinking about how to analyze the obtained data. At the end of the course, students present a project, in which they come up with a research question, design an experiment, collect and analyze the data, and try to answer the question. MGT 620 or equivalent is required; basic knowledge of statistics is expected.",
