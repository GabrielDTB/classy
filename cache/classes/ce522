  "name": "Parametric Modeling in the Urban Environment",
  "description": "Parametric modeling links mathematical modeling with spatial modeling. The course provides a practical introduction to the concepts and application of parametric modeling, using examples from the built environment to apply those techniques at a number of scales ranging from a city-scale urban grid to the individual building elements within it. The course will be structured around the practical, hands-on application of the techniques addressed, using Grasshopper 3d as the primary parametric programming platform. The history, theory, and broader applications of computational parametric modeling and design will be periodically addressed where needed and more in-depth reading swill be provided as supplementary texts.",
