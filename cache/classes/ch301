  "description": "A course for advanced undergraduate in the sciences, especially chemistry, biology and chemical biology, focusing on the ethical problems unique to the chemical profession. Special emphasis will be given to situations in which there is not a simple correct answer but only a number of imperfect alternatives. There will be class discussions of various case studies. This course is recommended by the Committee on Professional Training of the American Chemical Society as a component of ACS Certification. It is not a course in general theories of ethics, but a course on problems encountered in the chemical and biological profession.",
