  "description": "This course will use tools and techniques which have proven to be of value in recognizing patterns, making predictions, and evaluation risk from both large data sets (using data-mining techniques), and small data sets (using networks constructed from problem definition and discovery). Both approaches are critical to todayâ€™s engineers and managers, because they span a range of possible data availability and reliability. Using these tools and techniques, the student will survey applications, and have hands-on experimentation with both data mining and network construction, using real-world examples and situations.",
