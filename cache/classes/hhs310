  "description": "This course analyzes science as a social entity. The connections between science and society are studied in the first instance through a historical survey of the externals of science: the non-cognitive social, institutional, and professional dimensions of the scientific enterprise. On a case-study basis, the course proceeds to investigate more theoretical problems concerning relations between scientific knowledge and social structure, particularly as interpreted in the Strong Program of the Sociology of Knowledge. Students complete individual projects arising out of themes developed in class.",
