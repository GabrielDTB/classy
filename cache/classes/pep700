  "id": "PEP 700",
  "name": "Quantum Electron Physics and Technology Seminar",
  "description": "This seminar is focused on nanostructure-scale electron systems that are so small that their dynamic and statistical properties can only be properly described by quantum mechanics. This includes many submicron semiconductor devices based on heterostructures, quantum wells, superlattices, etc., and it interfaces solid state physics with surface physics and optics. Outstanding visiting scientists make presentations, as well as some faculty members and doctoral research students discussing their thesis work and related journal articles. Participation in these seminars is regarded as an important part of the research education of a physicist working in condensed matter physics and/or surface physics and optics.",
