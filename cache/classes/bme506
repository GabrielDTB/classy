  "description": "This course reviews basic engineering principles governing materials and structures such as mechanics, rigid body dynamics, fluid mechanics and solid mechanics and applies these to the study of biological systems such as ligaments, tendons, bone, muscles, joints, etc. The influence of material properties on the structure and function of organisms provides an appreciation for the mechanical complexity of biological systems. Methods for both rigid body and deformational mechanics are developed in the context of bone, muscle, and connective tissue. Multiple applications of Newtonâ€™s Laws of mechanical are made to human motion.",
