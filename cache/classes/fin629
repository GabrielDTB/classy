  "description": "This is an intermediate/advanced level course that addresses money flows and the cost of credit for major money market institutions, including banks, bank holding companies and the \"shadow banking\" system. It entails a broad survey of the structure and financial condition of the banking industry. The course provides a theoretical and practical understanding of why these markets exist, who the key players are; how the markets work, the rules governing their operation and how they are evolving. We will spend considerable time in discussing regulation of the financial markets and financial services industry.",
