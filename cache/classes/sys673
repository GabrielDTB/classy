  "description": "This third course focuses on the continuous implementation, integration, testing, analysis, and verification and validation of cyber systems (CPS). This course builds on Course 2 using a metaphor where the students plan on a successful product launch, using our project to work through continuous integration and test and ultimately bringing a robust solution to life in the form of a working CPS system. We intersperse lectures with individual and group project based activities to ensure that the developed system is functional and robust. We discuss and use the most effective techniques for fault and failure tolerance, analysis, and testing method and principles. We plan to capitalize on simulation and physical systems resources for continuous and automated testing and discuss the balance of testing versus analysis. The students will continuously collect evidence of quality, performance measures and traceability information.",
