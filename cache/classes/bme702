  "description": "International graduate students may arrange an educationally relevant internship or paying position off campus and receive Curricular Practical Training (CPT) credit via this course. Students must maintain their full time status while receiving CPT. Prior approval of the program director is required for enrollment. To justify enrollment, the student must have a concrete commitment from a specific employer for a specific project, and must provide to the program director for his/her approval a description of the project plus a statement from the employer that he/she intends to employ the student. This information must be provided to the program director with sufficient advance notice so that the program director has time to review the materials and determine if the project is appropriate. The project must be educationally relevant; i.e., it must help the student develop skills consistent with the goals of the educational program. During the semester, the student must submit written progress reports. At the end of the semester, the student must submit for grading a written report that describes his/her activities during that semester, even if the activity remains ongoing. The student must also present his/her activities in an accompanying oral presentation that is also graded.",
