  "description": "This course provides a comprehensive overview of infection associated with tissue-contacting biomedical devices. Such infection occurs when microbes colonize the surface of a tissue-contacting biomedical device, such as a joint prosthesis or a pacemaker, and lead to chronic infection of the surrounding tissue with substantial consequences to the patient and the health-care system. This course will address the clinical problem, the basic microbiology associated with bacterial biofilms, and the materials science associated with the design and development of new infection-resisting biomedical devices.",
