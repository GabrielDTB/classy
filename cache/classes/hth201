  "description": "The theatre’s ability to cultivate empathy, to raise questions about societal practices, to explore the human condition, to foster collaboration, and to create community make it a dynamic and unique forum in which to participate as audience or practitioner. This course examines the development of the theatre from its roots in Ancient Greece to the present day. Students will examine that evolution from a number of critical points: theatre’s literature, history, technological innovations, and social role. The class will read works of dramatic literature and historical texts. Attendance at NYC theatrical productions and \"hands-on\" exposure to the process of theatrical creation will complement the course readings.",
