  "description": "The study of concurrency as it appears at all levels and in different types of computing systems. Topics include: models of concurrency; languages for expressing concurrency; formal systems for reasoning about concurrency; the challenges of concurrent programming; race conditions; deadlock; livelock and nondeterministic behavior; prototypical synchronization problems, such as readers-writers and dining philosophers; mechanisms for solution of these problems, such as semaphores, monitors, and conditional critical regions; important libraries for concurrent programming; message passing, both synchronous and asynchronous; and applications of multithreaded concurrent programming and parallel algorithms. Substantial programming required. Pre-requisite: Undergraduate courses in Systems Programming or Operating Systems or CS 520 or CS 392.",
