  "description": "This course introduces students to international and national safety and security issues of importance to officials in the maritime industry, including the UN International Maritime Organization, U.S. Coast Guard, vessel owners and operators, marine facility management, and Port Authorities. Risk-based analyses are performed to assess safety and security concerns related to vessel and shore labor practices, navigational safety including cargo (e.g., oil spills) and vessel traffic (e.g., collisions) movements, Maritime Domain Awareness, sensor technology, and potential terrorist activities. Students receive instruction in the procedures required for the identification, analysis, prevention, and mitigation of safety and security problems associated with the various threats to human safety, vessels, critical infrastructure, and sensitive marine environments. Students are introduced to the concepts of risk assessment and management, vessel traffic management systems, ship and port security planning, facility contingency planning, and event response planning. State, Federal, and international regulations and guidelines related to maritime safety and security are discussed. Case studies from the New York/New Jersey region and other port regions are employed in the delivery of this instruction.",
