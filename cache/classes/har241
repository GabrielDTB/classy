  "description": "Almost everything we see and touch has been designed: someone made the decision to use Helvetica on that box of cereal, to make the stop sign a certain shape and color. Design lets us communicate, create relationships between a person and an object or ideas, improve accessibility, and shape our experience of the world. In this class, students will learn the fundamentals of graphic design with a focus on process and tools. Our goal will be developing visual language that communicates ideas while being aesthetically satisfying. By the end of the semester students will know how to use layout, typography, and images to tell stories and communicate ideas.",
