  "description": "The purpose of this course is to provide the conceptual frameworks and decision tools required for the success in both technology-based and non-technology-based markets: the student learns to define and select specific customer segments; to monitor the business environment for both opportunities and threats, with particular attention to the ever changing technological and global context; and to develop marketing strategies for serving each targeted customer segment profitably. Although this course introduces the student to the basic theory and analytical methods characterizing modern marketing practice, there is an emphasis on both the marketing of technology products/services as well as the impact of technology on the general practice of marketing. Students are required to present both detailed marketing plans and several rigorous case analyses.",
