  "description": "The capstone course of the four-core series continues the study and practice of the French languageâ€™s communicative skills (reading, writing, listening, speaking). Students will learn to use various tenses (conditional, plus-que-parfait) to describe and narrate events, give commands, discover more sophisticated usages of the subjunctive to express uncertainty and doubt, and develop a level of fluency that will permit study and work abroad in the foreign language. They will have significant and frequent opportunities to use the language for real-world purposes. Students will encounter literature from France and the French-speaking world, and further discover popular culture through communicative multimedia videos, French news websites, cinema, and class discussions. The course will be conducted entirely in French.",
