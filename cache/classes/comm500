  "name": "Foundations of Business and Professional Communications",
  "description": "The course covers topics that include brainstorming, organizing, writing and revision of technical documents, as well as preparation of verbal presentations with visual aids. In this overview class, students will be exposed to these skills, and have time to generate their own documents and presentations for feedback, but COMM 500 is primarily designed to give the students a foundation so that they may continue on with other, more specialized, classes in this field. Students in need of ESL/ESD attention will receive it. The course may be offered as a week-long intensive class designed to get students familiar with the basic concepts and tools they will need to master in order to pursue the Certificate Program in Professional Communications or other Stevens graduate degrees or programs.",
