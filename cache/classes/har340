  "description": "The foundation of design is built on typography and shape and process, but today design is much more than just solutions to visual problems. Design is about problem-making, responding to the world, offering up new visual ideas, thinking through materials, social responsibility, and communicating ideas between people. This semester, weâ€™ll build on the fundamentals you learned in Design I, but will be focusing on processes that cross the analog/digital divide, on designing experiences with multiple pages and screens, and ways to connect how you work with what you make.",
