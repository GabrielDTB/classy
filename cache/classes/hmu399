  "description": "In this course, students will develop their own creative collaboration practices. The course serves as the culmination for the Creative Collaboration course series. Students will be self-directed in their ensemble and band work. Readings, audio recordings, and video documentation will be chosen in accordance with each groupâ€™s creative goals and artistic process. Class time will largely serve as studio workshop time, with periodic group critiques and the opportunity for groups to meet individually with the instructor to refine and strengthen their unique styles and practices. The course will culminate in a live performance.",
