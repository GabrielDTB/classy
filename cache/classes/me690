  "description": "This course is designed to introduce the students to the theoretical and experimental approaches to understanding the architecture and mechanics of cellular biology. Emphasis is placed on the mechanical analysis of cytoskeletal filaments, membranes and adhesions as well as the various instrumentation tools used for in vitro characterization of these cell components and phenomena. Also explored are the various models used to describe cell mechanics and the role of converting a mechanical perturbation into a biological cell response, i.e. mechanotransduction in normal physiology. Knowledge of basic cell biology is not assumed and will be systematically reviewed.",
