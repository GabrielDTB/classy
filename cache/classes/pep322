  "description": "The goal of this course is to teach systematic design techniques used in optical engineering. This includes the selection, evaluation, and development of a project concept. Techniques for performing background research of current state of the art, evaluation of alternative designs, base case designs, and economic analysis of the development and operating costs are introduced with an emphasis on the principles of team-based projects. Tools and techniques introduced in earlier optics courses will be brought together as part of the design process. Students are encouraged to use this experience to select their senior design capstone project and form teams.",
