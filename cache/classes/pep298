  "name": "SKIL II: Digital Electronics and Microprocessor Controlled Measurements",
  "description": "SKIL II is a continuation of SKIL I. Whereas in SKIL I emphasis was placed on making analog measurements, in SKIL II we explore the concepts of digital logic circuits and their application to more complex measurement systems using microprocessor controllers such as Arduino. Students will learn the basics of Boolean logic, their implementation using integrated circuits and their ultimate expression using microprocessor controllers. Students will also gain experience in coding by programming the Arduino to carry out specific measurements.",
