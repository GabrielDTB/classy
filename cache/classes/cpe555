  "description": "The miniaturization of electronics and increasingly sophisticated software environments has enabled the realization of systems that embed intelligence within a wide variety of systems interacting in real time with the environment. Such systems are characterized by hardware/software integration along with integration of both analog and digital electronics. Representative topics include specification of the overall system, real-time operating system, embedded network protocols, tradeoffs between hardware and software, etc. The lectures will be complemented by projects related to design of such systems.",
