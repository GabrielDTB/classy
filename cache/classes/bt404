  "description": "In the 21st century, marketing professionals must go beyond the traditional profit-centric and market-share-centric view, and consider the larger impact of Marketing as a discipline on the society and the world. Marketers frequently find themselves having to stake their positions on political and social movements (e.g. Black Lives Matter, MeToo, climate change, sustainability). This new reality necessitates addressing questions ranging from business ethics to social responsibility to better understanding the role between \"socially responsible\" Marketing and the financial performance of firms. There is also a vast and growing field of Non-Profit Marketing, generally not covered in Marketing courses, which offers students opportunities to pursue marketing in a context not dictated by profit assumptions.",
