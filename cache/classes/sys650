  "description": "This course discusses the fundamentals of system architecting and the architecting process, along with practical heuristics. Furthermore, the course has a strong \"how-to\" orientation, and numerous case studies are used to convey and discuss good architectural concepts as well as lessons learned. Adaptation of the architectural process to ensure effective application of COTS will also be discussed. In this regard, the course participants will be introduced to an architectural assessment and evaluation model. Linkages between early architectural decisions, driven by customer requirements and concept of operations, and the system operational and support costs are highlighted.",
