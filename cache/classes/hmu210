  "description": "This course will introduce music technology as a compositional platform to construct non-traditional musical structures that do not strictly adhere to typical western musical conventions of melody, harmony, rhythm and meter. Instead, students will focus on the creation of envelopes, frames and forms of sonic structure; the use of sound as a primary compositional resource. Students will interrogate recent music production environments and emerging approaches to multi-channel (surround sound) loudspeaker systems in order to create original electroacoustic works for 8.1 surround sound. This course will incorporate current research trends within the sonic arts community, specifically focusing on emerging spatial audio methodologies and the perceptual implications of acousmatic structures.",
