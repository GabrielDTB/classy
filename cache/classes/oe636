  "title": "Topics in the Application of Stochastic Process Theory in Ocean Engineering",
  "description": "An expansion upon three important topics introduced in OE 205. The first topic is random data reduction and interpretation in ocean engineering; and basic methods of auto- and cross-spectral analysis, statistical errors, design of experiments, and directional-wave spectra estimation. The second deals with the application of probabilistic design methods in ocean engineering; and the third is a survey of the state-of-the-art marine applications of nonlinear random process theory.",
