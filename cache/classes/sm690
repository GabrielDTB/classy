The second part of the course will focus on studying published articles and project reports on how to design project tasks, how to analyze scientific, engineering, and survey data, and how to present and report processed data. Final products will include a proposal clearly identifying the goals of a sustainability project and proposing methods to fulfill the goals, plus a \"mock\" journal article based on real life natural science or social science sustainability data that will be provided to students depending on their disciplinary backgrounds.",
