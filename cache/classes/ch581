  "name": "Biochemistry II: Biomolecular Structure and Function",
  "description": "Discusses the physical and structural chemistry of proteins and nucleotides, as well as the functional role these molecules play in biochemistry. Extensive use of known X-ray structural information will be used to visualize the three-dimensional structure of these biomolecules. This structural information will be used to relate the molecules to known functional information.",
