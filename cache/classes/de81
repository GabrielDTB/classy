  "description": "This course will introduce and review the organization and logic of English rhetoric. It will demonstrate how these principles can be useful not only in writing, but also in reading, listening to lectures and giving oral presentations. There will be practice in oral presentation including discrete pronunciation elements of stress, intonation and rhythm (segmentals and supersegmentals) as well as presentation and discussion skills. Students will review the mechanics of sentence structure and verb tenses and learn to develop coherence within and between paragraphs. Library use will be introduced.",
