Students read and view a range of works that illustrate aesthetic and cultural aspects of modernism, including political, social, and religious matters, and the influence of technology on works by Hart Crane, Fernand LÃ©ger, George Antheil, and others. The course is not intended as a survey of the principal modernist texts and films but rather as an introduction to certain key notions and modes that are characteristic of modernism.",
