  "description": "This course examines the real-world space mission operations. Taking a process-oriented approach, the course provides an in-depth view of the entirety of space mission operations, including the concept of operations and all functions that are performed in support of a space mission. Interactive discussions focus on initial requirements definition, operations concept development, functional allocation among spacecraft, payload, ground system and operators. A detailed model is provided that allows the user to estimate operations complexity and then prepare an estimate of the number of operators required and overall cost. This is a hands-on course with a focus on space missions for science, military and commercial applications.",
