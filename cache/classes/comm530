  "name": "Writing for Engineers",
  "description": "This course is an introduction to writing for engineers. As technical writers, engineers may often feel their task to be only one of \"informing,\" but as has been dramatically illustrated over the last few years, \"informing\" can be vital to successful system deployment and operation. Lives are often affected by not only the accuracy of an engineerâ€™s calculations, but by a clear and understandable presentation of conclusions and recommendations. The ability to write clearly and effectively is essential to an engineer.",
