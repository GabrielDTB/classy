  "description": "The capstone course of the four-core series continues the study and practice of the Spanish language’s communicative skills (reading, writing, listening, speaking). The focus of the course is on developing students’ language proficiency through grammar instruction and review, vocabulary building exercises, readings of original texts, examination of contemporary film, and the exploration of the link between literature, film, language, and culture through writing and conversation. This course is designed as a general review of most grammatical concepts learned in previous Spanish courses, and to aid students in transition to upper-level Spanish courses. They will have significant and frequent opportunities to use the language for real- world purposes. The course will be conducted entirely in Spanish.",
