  "name": "Independent Study - Competitions",
  "description": "The Independent Study for Competitions is designed to be independent of the classroom experience. It gives students the opportunity to be involved with and prep for a competition while earning a bit of course credit. This student would work under the individual direction of a faculty member, referred to here as the \"faculty sponsor\" and would focus on a single competition. In no instances may professional work at an internship be appropriate as a basis for the Independent Study and the work done for this competition will be unpaid.",
