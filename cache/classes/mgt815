  "description": "This zero-credit extra-curricular course provides a supervised self-learning environment designed to help students develop the technical and professional skills needed for success in their academic programs and in their future careers. There will be multiple sections of the course each designed to satisfy the needs of a specific group of students and offered at a specific time period, for example, in the winter intersession. Under the supervision of an instructor/mentor each student will develop a self-improvement plan to be executed over the duration of the course. The plan could include participating in a research project, competing in a competition or completing one or more learning modules from a commercial provider. Study/self-development plans involving teams of students will be encouraged. A Certificate of Achievement will be awarded to students who submit evidence that they have successfully executed their plans.",
