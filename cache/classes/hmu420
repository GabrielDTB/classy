  "title": "Spatial Music Applications",
  "description": "Spatial Music Applications will explore the intersection between the spatial features of traditional music structures and the environmental soundscape. The course will present a perspective on aesthetics through the creation of original spatial audio works. Students will engage with spatial music applications, composing large-scale sonic works for multi-channel loudspeaker arrays. Students will develop their own spatialization tools in order create dynamic spatial works; interrogating the notion of dynamic spatial gesture as a means to develop compositional narrative and to function as a temporal sonic signature.",
