  "name": "Chemical Process Simulation",
  "description": "The course comprises a series of workshops, employing an industrial process simulator, Aspen Plus, which explore the primary components required to simulate a chemical process. Most workshops have embedded irregularities designed to heighten the student awareness of the types of errors that could arise when using simulation software. The workshops include facilities to exercise and customize a wide variety of physical and thermodynamic properties as the students develop process models. Heavy concentration is on the equations describing the models used. As the experience level of the students rises, workshops designed to introduce complicated industrial flowsheets are employed.",
