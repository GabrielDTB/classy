  "description": "Music Composition is a one semester course that presents a detailed analysis of the techniques of music composition. The course will focus on Form and Structure, Stylistic Movements, and Compositional Techniques. Students will be expected to demonstrate their understanding of all concepts presented in class via a series of quizzes and two significant works they will compose during the course of the semester. Music Composition will deepen the students understanding and implementation of the various techniques of musical composition. Since all students will have completed HMU202 (formerly 302), HMU310 will allow for a stronger and more coherent understanding of the implementation of those concepts and will greatly enhance the students understanding of the concepts presented in HMU 303 & 304 & 405.",
