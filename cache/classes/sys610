  "description": "Addressing complex systems and enterprises such as healthcare delivery, sustainable energy, financial systems, urban infrastructures and national security requires knowledge and skills from many disciplines. This course provides a valuable guide to all the disciplines involved in such endeavors. The central construct in is the notion of phenomena, particularly the essential phenomena that different disciplines address in complex systems and enterprises. Phenomena are observed or observable events or chains of events. Examples include the weather, climate change, traffic congestion, information sharing, and cultural compliance. This course provides a holistic approach that explicitly addresses the interactions among such phenomena and central tradeoffs underlying truly creative solutions.",
