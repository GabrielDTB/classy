  "description": "This course is designed to provide doctoral students with an in-depth knowledge about the research process in technology management and related disciplines. The course content includes assigned readings about conducting academic research in general, as well as assigned readings related to public Howe School research colloquium presentations by different guest speakers during the course of the semester. Students will prepare for the presentation by reading the assigned papers and writing up a set of questions to be posed during the discussion with the presenter, which will take place after the presentation. Each semester there will be six or seven guest speakers who will formally present their research during the first hour of the seminar. After the talk, guest speakers will discuss issues related to conducting research with doctoral students. In the weeks without guest speakers, students discuss assigned readings related to conducting academic research with other class members.",
