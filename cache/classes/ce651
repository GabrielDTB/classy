  "title": "Drainage Design and Modeling",
  "description": "Drainage design includes watershed analysis combined with hydrologic and hydraulic computations. The basic laws of drainage design will be discussed including the environmental and economic implications. Regulations pertinent to the area will also be addressed. Concepts of open channel, pressure and gravity flow will be discussed. Mathematical and computer models will be used to educate the engineer in the techniques available in industry. These models combined with the mathematical principals presented will aid the engineer in developing the best possible design for a particular region.",
