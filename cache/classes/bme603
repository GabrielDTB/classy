  "description": "The engineering applications of biological transport phenomena are important considerations in basic research related to molecules, organelles, cell and organ function; the design and operation of devices such as filtration units for kidney dialysis, high density cell culture and biosensors; and applications including drug and gene delivery, biological signal transduction and tissue engineering. This course develops the fundamental principles of transport processes, the mathematical expression of these principles and the solution of transport equations, along with characterization of composition, and function of living systems to which they are applied.",
