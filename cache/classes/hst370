  "description": "This course examines how matters of biological and environmental determinism have been treated by scientists, humanists, activists, and other prominent Americans from the 18th century through the present day. Students will approach this subject through the disciplinary lenses of science and technology studies, and examine sources that illuminate conceptualizations of the nature-nuture distinction in relation to biology, race, class, intelligence, health, and athletic ability from the \"Founding Fathers\" through the 21st century. Readings can include selections from Thomas Jefferson, Charles Darwin, Francis Galton, Booker T. Washington, the founders of the American eugenics movement, Franz Boas, Margaret Mead, B.F. Skinner, and the authors of \"The Bell Curve.\"",
