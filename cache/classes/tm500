  "description": "The goal of this course is to provide students with the background in calculus necessary for the telecommunications curriculum. Topics covered include review of algebra, coordinates in the plane and functions, differentiation, series, geometric series and exponential series, elements of counting, illustrations of the material on discrete distributions, z-transform, integration of simple functions, integrals over the entire line and basic probability densities. The eleven topics listed can be expanded or contracted depending on how students react to the material. E.g. the topic of functions of two variables can be changed by emphasizing discrete functions and their relationship to joint distributions. Some topics (e.g. coordinates in the plane and functions) may require two sessions. However, it is planned to cover the entire material in 13 sessions.",
