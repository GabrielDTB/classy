  "description": "Design of differential amplifiers using BJTs or FETs, design of output stages (class B and class AB), output and input impedance of differential amplifiers, frequency response. Feedback amplifiers, Nyquist criteria, Nyquist plots and root loci, bode plots, gain/phase margins and application in compensation for operational amplifiers, oscillators, tuned amplifiers and filters (passive and active). A suitable circuit analysis package is used for solving many of the problems.",
