Students will end the semester with; a thorough understanding of large frame in-line audio mixing consoles, additional advanced microphone placement techniques, and understanding of transducer experimentation. Synchronization between analog machines and digital audio workstations and MIDI interfaces will be explored. The student will gain the ability to troubleshoot and avoid externally generated noise in an audio system. Students will experience the entire engineering process that goes into integrating tracks from a live recording session with songs, from running the original recording session to producing the final mix.
