  "description": "This course emphasizes building analytical skills for developing mathematical models for decision-making and optimization, in many cases under uncertainty. The course is an introduction to stochastic operations research (OR) concepts and analysis techniques for mathematical programming and decision making. Basic computers skills (Excel) and knowledge of probability and statistics are necessary to solve the problems discussed in the lectures and assigned for homework. The course emphasis is on problem formulation, model building, data analysis, solution techniques, and evaluation of alternative designs/processes in complex systems. Modeling techniques and methods for decision analysis Markov processes, dynamic programming, metaheuristics, queueing, inventory theory, and forecasting models are covered.",
