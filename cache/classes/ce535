  "name": "Stormwater Management",
  "description": "The management of stormwater must be addressed for any modern development or construction project. The interdisciplinary nature of stormwater is relevant to protecting environmental resources and water supplies, preventing combined sewer overflows and local flooding, minimizing pollutant discharges to water bodies, and planning for livable cities. This course will focus on technical design for urban stormwater control, including Green Infrastructure technologies such as living/ green roofs, bio-retention, permeable pavement, and conventional solutions such as detention and retention ponds and constructed wetlands. The course will emphasize engineering solutions for practical applications, in the context of regulations imposed by both state and federal agencies.",
