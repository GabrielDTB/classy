  "description": "This course focuses on dynamics and vibrations of nonlinear systems. Examples include micro-electro mechanical systems, population and epidemic dynamics, friction-induced and contact-induced vibrations, nonlinear rotor vibrations, and fluid-induced vibrations. The course covers: equilibrium solutions and periodic solutions of nonlinear systems; linearization of nonlinear systems; stability analysis; transient and steady state dynamics of conservative and dissipative systems, using geometrical, computational and analytical tools, such as phase space and Poincare maps; perturbation methods, averaging method and the method of multiple scales; energy methods. This course will help the students understand different types of nonlinearities in various mechanical systems, and learn modeling and analysis tools to study nonlinear dynamical response of such systems.",
