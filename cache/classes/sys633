  "description": "This unique course gives students a hands-on opportunity to apply key principles of space systems engineering. In part 1 of the course, students are given a set of customer expectations in the form of broad mission objectives. Using state-of- the-industry mission design and analysis tools (provided), the task is to apply systems engineering process to define top- level system requirements and design key elements of the system. The end result will be a system design review during which students present and defend their design decisions. In part 2 of the course, students experience system realization processes first-hand by integrating, verifying, validating and delivering the shoe box-sized EyasSAT educational satellite. Lecture is combined with hands-on experience. From the part-level to the system level, students will implement a rigorous assembly, integration, verification and validation plan on real hardware and software applying \"test like you fly, fly like you test\" principles.",
