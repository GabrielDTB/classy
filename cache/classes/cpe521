  "name": "Autonomous Mobile Robotic Systems",
  "description": "This course will offer the students an overview of the technology of autonomous mobile robotic systems the mechanisms that allow a mobile robot to move through a real-world environment to perform its tasks. Since the design of any successful mobile robot involves the integration of many different disciplines -- among them kinematics, signal analysis, information theory, artificial intelligence, and probability theory -- the course will discuss all facets of mobile robotic system, including hardware design, wheel design, kinematics analysis, sensors and perception, localization, mapping, motion planning, navigation, and robot control architectures. Multi-robot systems will also be introduced due to their broader applications, such as search and rescue tasks, and exploring tasks.",
