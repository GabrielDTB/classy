  "description": "Cities, even large global mega-cities, can best be understood as a collection of communities in neighborhoods, all served by common urban infrastructures. To many citizens, those infrastructures were invisible until they failed in times of crisis. Their lack of resilience brought home the point that community needs drive the functional requirements for buildings and infrastructure. Delivered as a combination of lectures and seminars, we can begin to address questions such as \"How do we measure functionality at the many scales that affect community?\" and \"How are their benefits and costs delivered to each significantly different community within the city?\" Finally, \"How do we measure the resilience we seek to achieve at a community level?\"",
