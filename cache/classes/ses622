  "description": "Presents principles and processes for designing secure systems, including how to approach stakeholder needs analysis, to distinguish between needs and solutions, and to translate security requirements into design specifications. Students will learn how the fundamental organization of a system contributes to or detracts from the engineerâ€™s ability to provide secure design, and to recognize how security-related components compose a system of interest within any system. The course will provide an understanding of the difference between functional and nonfunctional requirements for security features as well as an understanding of how security requirements may be derived from unintended inputs and undesired outputs.",
