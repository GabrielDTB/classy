  "description": "This course extends concepts present in tissue engineering, biotransport and biomaterial to develop design principles for generating tissue and organs in-vitro. The processes which cells integrate proteins and extracellular matrix to form functioning organ systems are developed. The principles of bioreactor design are sued to analyze and design in-vitro systems for growing functioning tissue and organs for use as prostheses. Principles of Scale-up to organs of different size are discussed. Design issues and limitations for extension of these principles to multi-organ systems are illustrated.",
