  "title": "Optimal Control Theory",
  "description": "The main purpose of this course is to present the foundations of the optimal control theory, some applications, and their solutions. The students will be introduced to the core concepts and results of control and system theory. The foundational and basic results will be derived for discrete and continuous time scales, and state variables. Topics to be covered: proportional- derivative control; state-space and spectrum assignment; outputs and dynamic feedback; reachability; controllability; feedback and stability; Lyapunov theory; linearization principle of observability; dynamic programming algorithm; multipliers for unconstrained and constrained controls; and Pontryagin maximum principle.",
