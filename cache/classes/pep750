  "description": "This course is open to students who have taken PEP 754 or its equivalent. It concerns itself with modern field theory; such topics as Yang-Mills fields, the renormalization group, and functional integration. It will concern itself with applications to both elementary particles and condensed matter physics; i.e. the theory of critical exponents. Typical text: C. Quigg, Gauge Theories of Strong, Weak, and Electromagnetic Interactions.",
