  "description": "A brief review of principal notions and methods of mathematical analysis, such as metric spaces, compactness, differentiability, Riemann-Stieltjes integration, function series, and Banach spaces. The module emphasizes key examples and basic applications over in-depth exploration of the notions. The students are expected to be familiar with multivariable calculus to the extent of MA 227 or an equivalent course.",
