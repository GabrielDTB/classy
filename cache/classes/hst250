  "description": "This course will introduce students to the interdisciplinary field of medical humanities. Course readings and materials will draw from the humanities (literature, history, philosophy, ethics), social sciences (anthropology, sociology, political science, psychology), and the arts (visual arts, theatre, film) to examine the myriad ways in which humans think about, experience, and understand health, illness, and the practice of medicine. Topics may include infectious disease, noninfectious diseases, aging, childcare, fitness, public health, mental health, healthcare delivery, childbirth, and death. Students will be exposed to different ways of thinking about medicine, health, and illness, asked to critically engage with course materials, develop an understanding of the non-scientific aspects of healthcare, and reflect on their own and othersâ€™ life experiences.",
