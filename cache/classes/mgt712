  "title": "Survey of Management and Organization Theories",
  "description": "The goal of this PhD course is to familiarize PhD students in Management & Marketing, Information Systems & Analytics, and Finance with major conceptual frameworks, debates, and developments in foundational organization and management theories. This is an inter-disciplinary domain of inquiry that covers theories widely applied in business research, including theories that have emerged in business research as well as theories drawn primarily from economics, sociology, psychology, and political science. These theoretical perspectives provide explanations of intra- and inter-organizational processes, micro and macro phenomena, as well as the relationships between organizations and the contexts in which they are located. It is an overview course that prioritizes understanding of a wide range of theoretical perspectives over an in-depth understanding of specific theories.",
