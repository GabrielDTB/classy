  "description": "The care and use of data are essential to nearly all enterprises. As they enter the workforce, our students are increasingly expected to understand the entire value chain for data intensive products and services. This course builds on their previous studies in data engineering/data science/management, to train them to think critically about the process, tools, techniques, technologies, and governance for an entire data pipeline, from data through application, and to execute and document such a pipeline. The students will be presented with a combination of data and required business application information and will create case studies of a complete data pipeline. The data/application combinations will require students to think critically about all of the components of a complete project pipeline; to program such a pipeline using appropriate technology; and to write a clear, detailed report on the project, including the reasons for the decisions that were made and the alternatives that were considered.",
