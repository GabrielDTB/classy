  "description": "This course examines the politics and morality of science and technology. It uses an interdisciplinary perspective, known as Science and Technology Studies(STS), that includes anthropology, history, philosophy, and sociology. It begins by exploring the history of the field, which arose from scientistsâ€™ concerns about nuclear arms, atomic energy, and environmental degradation. It will introduce basic concepts such as social construction and technological determinism. Topics will include social studies of scientific community, the pursuits of objectivity, how politics and values are built into technologies, and perceptions of technological and environmental risk. The course emphasizes conceptual tools that students can apply in their own encounters with technology.",
