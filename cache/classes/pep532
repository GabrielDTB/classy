  "name": "Energy Production and Consumption",
  "description": "An integral course in the five-course cluster developed for the Stevens Math-Science Partnership Program, this course explores the science and technology behind energy production, distribution and consumption. Fundamental principles about energy at the microscopic scale are shown to underlie the operation of multiple energy production systems in use today. The course seeks to especially connect the concepts of societal energy usage with the underlying principles of chemical structure, thermodynamics, and chemical reactions to provide models for understanding critical energy issues. Patterns of energy consumption that define the modern world and the global impact that energy use has on human society are explored and provide the context.",
