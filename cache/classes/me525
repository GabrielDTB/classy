  "description": "This course introduces the fundamental principles of mechanics applied to the study of biological systems and relates the design of implants and prosthetics to the biomechanics of the musculoskeletal system. Specific types of tissue covered include bone, ligament, skeletal and cardiac muscle, and articular cartilage. An introduction to the basic concepts of continuum mechanics is provided, including finite-deformation kinematics, stress, constitutive equations, and the governing conservation laws of mass, momentum, and energy applied to deformable continua. Rigid-body kinematics is introduced in the context of applications in biomechanics.",
