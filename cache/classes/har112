  "description": "This course will approach the basics of drawing as an integrative tool where ideas and processes are explored and expanded through the drawing medium. Skills will be rendered through observation, manipulation, and coordinating and understanding these practices. Through problem solving within a range of projects, each student will begin to develop a visual language and the drawing skills that can be applied to conceptual, visual, and technical disciplines. Does not fulfill general humanities requirements; may be taken as a free elective.",
