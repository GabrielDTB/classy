Specific topics will vary with instructor, but broad considerations will include: Traditional custom and ritual and its import for the creation of advanced sculpture and carving, the impact of African independence movements on African visual arts, and the pre-colonial, colonial, and postcolonial contexts for the production of visual arts in Africa.",
