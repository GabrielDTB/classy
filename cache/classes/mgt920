  "description": "The preliminary exam takes the form of a paper/in-depth literature survey with components of originalities. The goal of the preliminary exam is twofold: 1) to evaluate if a student’s capabilities are befitting a doctoral student, and 2) to encourage students to get involved with scholarly research early in the program so they are equipped with skills necessary to excel in an academic career. By the end of the student’s second semester, the student, in consultation with the Ph.D. student advisor, must form a preliminary exam committee consisting of three School of Business faculty members, and communicate this to the Ph.D. Program Director for approval. The performance of all courses the student will be reviewed based on the quality of the write-up and oral examination. The committee’s composition and completion of the preliminary exam evaluation process should be submitted to the Ph.D. Program Director for approval no later than the end of the third semester from the date of first enrollment. Students have two chances to pass the exam and the second date has to be within 90 days from the publication of the first exam result. The Ph.D. committee has some discretionary power regarding the timings.",
