Startups with technology at their core, and service-to-mankind as their purpose. IDE 315’s educational goals are more experiential compared to IDE 314. Topics covered include principles behind customer acquisition, customer lifetime value (CLV), revenue streams, product pricing, market segmentation and growth (journey from beach-head to SAM and TAM), as well as the legal mechanics of patents, LLCs and incorporations. IDE 315’s incubation goals are in the creation and nurturing of real enterprises in partnership with the Stevens Venture Center (SVC). Such enterprises are able to establish a unique value proposition, a scalable-repeatable business model, and a sound investment thesis with students in a leadership role.",
