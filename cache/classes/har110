  "description": "This course traverses through the elemental study of two-dimensional art and design--structural elements, organizational principles, psychological effects, and communicative functions--focusing on both the technical and the imaginative. Problem- solving studio assignments and critiques combined with visits to museums and galleries enable students to develop criteria for the analysis and evaluation of images created both by themselves and by others.",
