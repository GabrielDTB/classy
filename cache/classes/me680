  "title": "Fundamentals of Micro & Nano Fluidics",
  "description": "As an introduction to micro/nano fluidics, course topics include basic fluid mechanical theories, experimental techniques, fabrication techniques and applications of micro/nano fluidics. The theory part will cover continuum fluid mechanics at micro/nano scales, molecular approaches, capillary effects, electrokinetic flows, acoustofluidics and optofluidics. The experimental part will cover micro/nano rheology and particle image velocimetry. The fabrication part will cover materials and machining techniques for micro/nano fluidic devices. The application part will cover micro/nano fluidic devices for flow control, life sciences and chemistry. As a term project, individual students are required to perform a case study for their own selected topic in micro/nano fluidics, to conduct a literature survey/summary and to propose/analyze their own new design idea of a micro/nano fluidic devices by utilizing the knowledge obtained throughout the course.",
