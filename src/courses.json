    "description": "Many major medical device design practices have been established or changed as a result of an event or group of events. This course examines current practices and their relationship to events which shaped them, providing rationale and historical context for these practices. Spanning the past century, this course begins by examining events which shaped early medical device regulations and standards. It describes the ramifications of those events and how guidelines and rules for medical device design were formulated or changed as a result. It then reviews unique considerations in current medical device design practices, including regulatory, research and reimbursement practices and special challenges in clinical use. Medical devices that were marketed but resulted in poor outcomes or with technical flaws are studied to illustrate general themes among goals and needs for improved medical device design practices in the future. Aiming to expose students to broadly relevant and current issues, in its entirety, this course reviews the top causes of death, the most expensive diseases and illnesses, and current performance issues with common medical devices. Each lesson summarizes at least one critical element of design strategy for medical devices. Selected examples represent common medical device design challenges. This course is geared toward students seeking or recently entering a career in medical devices. In many cases, medical device practices were based upon practices established for drug regulation, and so relevant pharmaceutical industry developments are also presented, making this course interesting and pertinent to a student pursuing a career in the pharmaceutical field as well. It is also strongly applicable to those pursuing careers involving technology in clinical settings, including hospitals, and in pre-clinical/clinical research. The material that is presented includes highlights from several hundred references. Most of the references are publicly available. Students are encouraged to review the references in their entirety if they want to know more about a topic. Recognizing the multi-disciplinary nature of this field, the course is suitable for a student in any engineering and science program.",

    "description": "This advanced course covers the role of key biological signal transduction pathways that regulate the function of mammalian cells. Importantly, this course also covers the cause and mechanism of action for cellular signal pathways that become dysregulated and cause a variety of diseases including cancer, allergy/inflammation, hypertension, and metabolic disease like diabetes. Concordant with learning about the causes of diseases will be discussions of drug development, and state-of-the-art enzyme/cell-based assays for monitoring the inhibition/activation of protein targets. Pathways explored include: GPCR, Protein Kinases, lipid mediators such as leukotrienes a mediator of asthma, secondary messengers such as calcium and cAMP, nuclear receptors, transcription factors, apoptosis and selected immune responses.",

In this course, fundamental concepts of mechanics such as continuum mechanics, viscoelasticity, growth, buckling, and mechanical experimentation will be used to understand the relation between brain function and form in health and disease. Students will be exposed to advanced concepts of the physiology and mechanical assessment of the nervous system. Learning materials will include lecture presentations, literature reviews, experimental data, and homework assignments. The course will conclude with a final project that may be a literature review, experimental study, or computational study and includes a project report.",

It progresses through the works of Eiffel, Roebling, Freyssinet, and Maillart to modern day innovators like Menn, Khan, and Calatrava. Students learn engineering concepts through technical presentations on structural landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, Guggenheim Museum, George Washington Bridge, and the Hearst Tower. The course studies beautiful works of structural art and takes site visits in the metropolitan area to supplement the classroom material. These trips will include the Brooklyn Bridge, Skyscraper Museum, Cast Iron District, Flatiron Building, Guggenheim Museum, and Hearst Building. The course converges engineering, architecture, design, and art into one distinguished field. It teaches the concepts and designs behind structural engineering, so high a quality in imaginative conception and execution, that the engineering itself takes on the aspects of art.",

There are two important aspects that have to be taken into account for a machine learning problem: how can we develop computationally efficient algorithms to learn useful information, and what is the prediction performance of the algorithm on unseen data. More importantly, is it possible to achieve the best of the two worlds, or there has to be some trade-off. This course will introduce students to concepts relating the computational efficiency and the statistical accuracy for a broad range of problems, including regression, classification, clustering, adaptive learning, to name a few. It will cover popular numerical methods that carry out state-of-the-art performance on the computational side, and it will also discuss possible improvement in the price of estimation accuracy and memory usage. The goal of the course is to help students understand these trade-offs from a theoretical perspective and guide them to design near-optimal algorithms for real-world problems.",

Furthermore, many conditions need to be fulfilled as directed by the International Student and Scholar Services (ISSS). In particular, students must remain in good standing throughout the practicum; prior approval of the graduate program coordinator, in consultation with the studentâ€™s academic advisor, is required for enrollment; the student must show evidence of a real commitment from a specific employer for a specific project, with preferably a detailed description of the project and job responsibilities. All these materials, including a job offer letter, must be provided to the program coordinator with sufficient advance notice so that the program coordinator has time to review the materials and determine if the project is appropriate. During the semester, the student must submit written monthly progress reports. At the end of the semester, the student must submit for grading a written report that describes their activities, even if the project is ongoing. The student must also present their activities in an accompanying oral presentation that is also graded. This is a one-credit course that may be repeated up to a total of three credits.",

The written component will be in the form of a 7-day take-home exam; b) Oral Component: The student presents a paper written for publication in a conference or journal OR the oral examination is based on the student's take-home examination. The examination committee can pass, fail, or request re-examination of either the written or oral component. The committeeâ€™s composition and completion of the evaluation process should be submitted to the Ph.D. Program Director for approval no later than the end of the fifth semester.

The treatment is mathematical, providing depth in the analytic formulations and analysis techniques. Digital signal processing techniques will be given particular emphasis, recognizing their considerable influence on present and emerging designs. However, these digital signal processing techniques will be supplemented by analog signal processing techniques will be supplemented by analog signal processing techniques, which continue to be important for front-ends of receivers (and will remain important as carrier frequencies continue to migrate to higher frequencies). In addition to covering the mathematical principles of digital and analog signal processing, the course will cover contemporary digital signal processors. The data processing issue arises in the coding of data for improved communications performance. Compression algorithms, reducing the amount of data that must be transmitted, coding techniques to provide error detection/protection, and encryption techniques to improve security are representative examples of data processing.",

Since many wireless systems involve connections among hardware developed by different commercial manufacturers, national and international standards play a major role in the evolution of wireless systems. Earlier first generation systems evolved to todayâ€™s second generation systems, with third generation systems expected shortly. One component of this course relates to these important standards. There are several fundamentally different wireless systems applications simultaneously evolving. Some relate to personal communications services (e.g., cellular telephony, wireless modems, etc.). Others relate to LANs, implemented in wireless rather than wired technologies to allow mobility or ease of access but providing data rates competitive with wired systems. Satellite communications systems (e.g., the Iridium system) are emerging and promise to provide a particularly interesting means of extending communication services. GPS systems provide an important means of determining oneâ€™s position to high accuracy. Digital and software radios exploit the familiar concept of radio transmissions to provide digital information (and draw upon channel assignment schemes related to the radio metaphor). In addition to the commercial development of separate (and non-integrated) wireless systems of the various types above, there are important military applications in which the various systems are integrated to provide a versatile communications systems designed for battlefield applications. Upon completion of this course, the student will have depth of understanding in the high-level, systems-oriented view of wireless systems.",

The artists and designers of these movements responded to contemporary political and social upheavals with utopian projects intended to inform lived social existence. The course investigates whether it is possible to found imagined societies with advanced design, visual arts, and architecture. Topics include: the notion of utopian societies, the relation between social change and design and urban planning, and the idea of the artist as engineer and founder of progressive societies.",

It is expected that Internship will run approximately 8 to 12 hours per week for 14 weeks (or 112 to 168 hours per academic session) per 3 credits. A scheduled bi-weekly meeting with a group to discuss internships and career interests is expected. The studentâ€™s internship performance will be evaluated by the following: a) a weekly journal describing the studentâ€™s involvement in various activities and projects; b) an approximately five-page reflective essay in which the student integrates prior coursework with the internship experience (a theory and practice exercise); c) a basic report indicating the extent to which scope of work was accomplished; d) attendance and participation in group meetings; e) a written evaluation from the studentâ€™s supervisor; f) a portfolio of work accomplished during the internship, if appropriate.

By sampling a wide array of works, notably films and literary texts, the course aims to destabilize normative sexual expectations while considering the consequences of social constructions to which individuals are conventionally subjected.

By considering these questions through the vehicle of fiction, literature elicits not only the audience or readersâ€™ intellect, but their emotions as well â€“ in both cases, by means of reader-response. One pressing question we will tackle is whether fiction that engages issues of power and politics does â€“ or can function to â€“ change the world.",

The aim throughout is to focus on works that an interested music lover is liable to hear in live performance, and that form a basis for further musical exploration. At the same time, the course provides, without losing this central focus, at least brief exposure and consideration of selected examples of both world music and commercial pop music in some of its various forms. Finally, and unique to the Music and Technology program at Stevens, the course draws special attention, wherever appropriate, to important milestones in the development of music technology and their impact on the development of musical style.",

This is especially so for the idea of evil. It is unclear whether evil is a phenomenon in its own right or a mere reduction of the good. Also, it is unclear how the reality of evil can be reconciled with the idea of the supreme goodness of God. The problem of good and evil raises the questions of human nature, the existence of free will, and humansâ€™ basic attitude toward suffering. In modernity, the problem of evil was given further emphasis through the advent of nihilism, for which no moral obligations exist, and the mass extinction carried out by totalitarian regimes.

Under suitable conditions these formats allow a stable representation and a reduction of the data size from exponential complexity (with respect to the dimension of the space) to a linear complexity, which kills the curse of dimensionality. Another goal of the course is to present variety of relatively novel unsupervised machine learning methods using matrix and tensor decompositions, as latent variable analysis based on (1) statistical independence and (2) sparsity assumptions, kernel and generalized principal component analysis, and non-negative tensor decomposition, all of which reveal hidden patterns in the data.",

Analytical solutions of PDEs are available only in some simple cases, and for almost any real-life problem, PDEs can be solved only approximately by numerical methods. This course introduces the widely used finite difference and finite element methods and discusses conditions under which the numerical schemes are stable and converge to the true solutions of the PDEs; the latter is critical for understanding when the predictions from the approximations obtained by the numerical methods can be trusted.

TDA-based algorithms have been successfully used for tasks such as identifying new cancer types, detecting warning signals for imminent financial market crashes, and optimizing materials for methane capture. As a generalization of graphs, simplical complexes formed from data are used for recognizing topological properties algorithmically and are introduced with natural motivating examples from areas such as neuroscience and multi-agent decision tasks. With this in mind, we turn to algebraic topology, specifically simplicial homology, and then follow the development and implementation of persistent homology. Common challenges in data science, such as clustering and dimension reduction, are repeated themes and appear naturally in the Mapper algorithm.

Emphasis is placed on how operations of and faults in systems and components can influence reactivity and core behavior. The students will examine a typical nuclear power plant and those components and systems of the nuclear plant system that have the potential for affecting core power and whose failure could be an initiating event for a plant transient. One main outcome is the ability to predict behavior under complex interactions among systems and to predict transient behavior of the integrated nuclear plant considering factors that are important for safe and efficient operation of the plant including reactivity management and control, coolant inventory control and core heat removal. A replica simulator (PCTRAN) is used as an effective way for students to understand accident control, emergency operating procedures and plant control.

    "description": "Many major medical device design practices have been established or changed as a result of an event or group of events. This course examines current practices and their relationship to events which shaped them, providing rationale and historical context for these practices. Spanning the past century, this course begins by examining events which shaped early medical device regulations and standards. It describes the ramifications of those events and how guidelines and rules for medical device design were formulated or changed as a result. It then reviews unique considerations in current medical device design practices, including regulatory, research and reimbursement practices and special challenges in clinical use. Medical devices that were marketed but resulted in poor outcomes or with technical flaws are studied to illustrate general themes among goals and needs for improved medical device design practices in the future. Aiming to expose students to broadly relevant and current issues, in its entirety, this course reviews the top causes of death, the most expensive diseases and illnesses, and current performance issues with common medical devices. Each lesson summarizes at least one critical element of design strategy for medical devices. Selected examples represent common medical device design challenges. This course is geared toward students seeking or recently entering a career in medical devices. In many cases, medical device practices were based upon practices established for drug regulation, and so relevant pharmaceutical industry developments are also presented, making this course interesting and pertinent to a student pursuing a career in the pharmaceutical field as well. It is also strongly applicable to those pursuing careers involving technology in clinical settings, including hospitals, and in pre-clinical/clinical research. The material that is presented includes highlights from several hundred references. Most of the references are publicly available. Students are encouraged to review the references in their entirety if they want to know more about a topic. Recognizing the multi-disciplinary nature of this field, the course is suitable for a student in any engineering and science program.",

Biofeedback is used in rehabilitation and in other movement-training paradigms to facilitate motor (re-)learning â€“ conveying biological sensor data to the end-user either concurrently (real-time) or terminally, after the movement is complete. For example, one emerging type of real-time biofeedback uses precise musical cues to convey biomechanics metrics to help people learn movement skills. Students will work in groups to design and experimentally evaluate an audio and/or visual biofeedback device of their choosing, as they develop skills using biomechanical sensors through lab assignments and communicate their device development in an IEEE-style paper. An additional unique aspect of the course is its community engagement: students will share their designs with younger students and/or the public, which will build studentsâ€™ abilities to present and teach new concepts.",

Such scientific basis consists of atom arrangements, defects, temperature effect on atom arrangements, entropy, and Gibbs free energy. Energy is used as a unifying theme throughout the course to explain engineering properties such as melting temperature, thermal expansion, diffusivity, fracture, and creep. Instead of addressing polymers, metals, and ceramics separately, this course uses an integrated approach to discussing engineering properties of these materials under the same scenarios. For example, fracture of metals, ceramics and polymers is discussed together to show the similarities and differences in behaviors and causes. Topics covered also include phase diagrams (e.g., SMA), mechanical properties, viscoelastic behavior, functional materials, composites, and fatigue. Materials selection and cost analysis discussed is useful for engineers to choose appropriate materials for their engineering designs.",

The Qualifying Exam for Ph.D. students consists of the following components: 1) A written academic paper; 2) A one-hour oral defense of the academic paper; 3) A conceptual written exam; 4) A review of the studentâ€™s coursework grades; 5) An English language competency evaluation. By the end of the studentâ€™s fourth semester, the student, in consultation with the Ph.D. studentâ€™s advisor, must form a qualifying exam committee consisting of three School of Business faculty members, and communicate this to the Ph.D. Program Director for approval. The evaluation of a studentâ€™s qualifying exam will be done by a committee of three tenured/tenure-track faculty members form the School of Business. The studentâ€™s faculty advisor will serve as the chair of the committee. The student and the advisor should work together to choose two more members for the committee. The committeeâ€™s composition and completion of the evaluation process should be submitted to the Ph.D. Program Director for approval no later than the end of the fifth semester from the date of enrollment. Students have two chances to pass the qualifying exam and the second date has to be within 90 days from the publication of the first exam result. The Ph.D. committee has some discretionary power regarding the timings.",

Approximate methods such as the Hartree-Fock and Density functional methods have been used but calculating the atomization energy of compounds accurately can take days using conventional techniques. Machine learning approaches to these problems have begun to show substantial improvement over traditional methods with respect to accuracy and efficiency. In other areas such as particle physics, where large amounts of collision data need to be analyzed rapidly and accurately, supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques have shown initial success. This is not only defined by the extremely successful running and analysis of Large Hadron Collider (LHC) data, but also by the availability of cosmological and astrophysical observations. Another aspect is the use of quantum systems to enhance the speed and power of traditionally slow machine learning techniques leading to the new exciting field of quantum machine learning. Both the use of classical machine learning applied to the analysis of quantum physics and the application of quantum systems to enhance classical machine learning algorithms will be discussed. Standard machine learning methods along with the basics of quantum information will be reviewed.",

PSM systems are comprehensive sets of policies, procedures and practices designed to ensure that barriers to major incidents are in place, in use and effective. The objectives of this course are to: define PSM and why it is important, describe each of the 12 elements and their applicability, identify process safety responsibilities, give real examples and practical applications to help better understand each element, share experiences and lessons learned of all participants, and assess the quality and identify enhancements to studentâ€™s site PSM program.",

To this end, the students will need to understand how many of the most common stock models are created and utilized. At the core of this is understanding Brownian motion and other adapted stochastic processes from a conceptual level, which requires the knowledge of quadratic variation, martingales, and filtrations. Using these building blocks, many different structures of stock and interest rate processes can be developed: geometric Brownian motion, stochastic volatility models, Cox-Ingersoll-Ross, and Vasicek to name a few. After this course, the students will be able to price simple derivatives based on some of these models. In addition, through the use of stochastic integration, students will have a better understanding of portfolio valuation. By the end of this course, the student will be able to derive in its entirety the Black-Scholes-Merton European option pricing formula for Geometric Brownian Motion.",

    "name": "Risk Management for Capital Markets",
    "description": "Risk Control and derivative pricing are major concerns for financial institutions. Yet, as recent events have shown us there is a real need for adequate statistical tools to measure and anticipate the amplitude of the potential moves of the financial market. Many of the standard models seen on Wall Street however are based on simplified assumptions and can lead to systematic (and sometimes dramatic) underestimation of real risks. Starting from a detailed analysis of market data, one can take into account more faithfully the real behavior of financial markets (in particular the rare events) for asset allocation, derivative pricing and hedging, and risk control. This course will introduce some concepts to better address these issues. There will also be a few sessions in the Hanlon lab learning to use a Bloomberg terminal. Various financial instruments will be presented in a form familiar to Wall Street traders (i.e. Bloomberg screens). The purpose of Risk Management is to provide a valuation of these financial contracts (\"pricing\") and to provide various measures of risk and methods to hedge these risks as best as possible (\"hedging\"). These tasks are not just performed by Risk Managers but by \"Traders\" who price and hedge their respective trading books on a daily basis. Successful trading (over extended periods of time) comes down to successful risk management. Successful risk management comes down to robust valuation which is the main prerogative of Financial Engineering. Valuation of financial instruments begins with an analysis of possible future events (i.e. stock price moves, interest rate moves, defaults, etc.). Dealing with the future involves the mathematics of statistics and probability. The first step is to find a probability distribution that is suitable for the financial instrument at hand. The next step is to calibrate this distribution. The third step is to generate future events using this calibrated distribution and based on this, provide the necessary valuation and risk measures for the financial contract at hand. The failure of any of these steps can lead to incorrect valuation and therefore an incorrect assessment of the risks of the financial instrument under consideration.",

While the components of these systems require no less design effort than in the past, attention to the components is not sufficient to ensure overall system success. This course focuses on the interactions between the elements of a complex system, the context within which they are designed and operate, and the relationships between the technical systems and the organizations that design them and the enterprises that they serve. Students develop the understanding of techniques and processes that can help them ensure that their individual contributions are not only excellent in themselves, but that they become part of a cohesive, successful whole.",

Critical elements include the ideas of systems and design thinking, and elegant design. An Ideation process, as pioneered by the likes of IDEA and other prominent design firms is used to spark the creative process. The opportunity is conceived and defined using Kano Maps, marketing segmentation and conjoint analysis techniques. A QFD process is used to collect, organize and analyze customer needs, and transform these into product specifications. Concepts are generated, selected and tested. Finally, these concepts are specified using concept of operation, conceptual design and using case scenarios and technical requires. A workshop on Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), particularly, SysML is used as a means for specification and also to provide a foundation for future modeling work. Lectures are interspersed with individual and group project based activities. the students go through a design review process in preparation for their final report.",

    "description": "Broadband Service Management is a comprehensive course for those interested in deploying and operating broadband networks from a technical and managerial aspect. A broadband networks success is based on its ability to deliver a desired service with a specific service requirement referred to as a Service Level Agreement (SLA). The Service Level Management whether it is with an operator, infrastructure vendor, Third Party Vendor (3PV) or customer all have specific Key Performance Indicators (KPI) associated with them. The ability to define, identify, and manage those Key Performance Indicators associated with a broadband network Service Level Agreement requires a thorough understanding of the entire broadband ecosystem. The course will present key topics and criteria required to implement and sustain a network. Emphasis will be placed on the ability to define performance quantities and manage the network balancing business risks while minimizing costs to meet the objectives of the broadband network.",
