For example, one emerging type of real-time biofeedback uses precise musical cues to convey biomechanics metrics to help people learn movement skills. Students will work in groups to design and experimentally evaluate an audio and/or visual biofeedback device of their choosing, as they develop skills using biomechanical sensors through lab assignments and communicate their device development in an IEEE-style paper.

Especially the role of mechanics remains understudied despite several relevant applications, including brain growth and folding during development, traumatic brain injury, surgical intervention, and structural changes associated with aging and neurodegenerative diseases. In this course, fundamental concepts of mechanics such as continuum mechanics, viscoelasticity, growth, buckling, and mechanical experimentation will be used to understand the relation between brain function and form in health and disease. Students will be exposed to advanced concepts of the physiology and mechanical assessment of the nervous system. Learning materials will include lecture presentations, literature reviews, experimental data, and homework assignments. The course will conclude with a final project that may be a literature review, experimental study, or computational study and includes a project report.",

    "description": "At its best, creativity in structural engineering leads to forms that are notable for their sculptural and aesthetic quality as much as for their structural intelligence. Structures that express this behavior clearly and elegantly achieve the highest levels of artistic creation, and become cultural symbols that exceed historical and cultural boundaries. This course explores Art in Structural Engineering as it evolves in modern history, beginning with the Cast Iron bridges of the Industrial Revolution. It progresses through the works of Eiffel, Roebling, Freyssinet, and Maillart to modern day innovators like Menn, Khan, and Calatrava. Students learn engineering concepts through technical presentations on structural landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, Guggenheim Museum, George Washington Bridge, and the Hearst Tower. The course studies beautiful works of structural art and takes site visits in the metropolitan area to supplement the classroom material. These trips will include the Brooklyn Bridge, Skyscraper Museum, Cast Iron District, Flatiron Building, Guggenheim Museum, and Hearst Building. The course converges engineering, architecture, design, and art into one distinguished field. It teaches the concepts and designs behind structural engineering, so high a quality in imaginative conception and execution, that the engineering itself takes on the aspects of art.",

A process is constructed stepwise, with continuing discussion of heuristics, recycle, purge streams, and other process conditions. Aspen is used for design and analysis of the process units. From the viewpoint of the process simulations, the course is divided into four categories: Component, property and data management; Unit operations; System simulation; and Process economic evaluation. The equations used by the simulator are discussed as well as convergence methods, loops and tear streams and scrutiny of default settings in the simulator. The factored cost method and profitability measures are reviewed and compared to simulator results. Work on a capstone design project is begun in the last section of the course.",

This course focuses on the technological and not on the legal components of the topic. The technical aspects will focus on analyzing both network and host data. This includes review of network traffic logs (pcap, flow records) and profiles and their types, identification of attack signatures and fingerprints, study of various traceback methods, application of data mining techniques, and the extraction of information (e.g., from malware, including botnet traffic) acquired through the use of network analysis tools and techniques, recovering evidence left behind, and technologies that can be used to assist in the analysis of obtained data or in obtaining more data. We will look into methodologies for recovering data from persistent storage and memory. Investigate the use of virtual machines in providing auditing capabilities to analysts and in setting traps for attackers. The class will not only cover the subjects in theory but instead also provide the students with an extensive hands-on experience. The class will involve a fair amount of programming.",

The student's faculty advisor recruits two additional faculty to form an examination committee (in most cases they continue as members of the student's dissertation committee). The examination committee designs the written and oral components of the qualifying exam: a) Written Component: The committee might design an exam composed of questions from classes the student has taken or they might ask the candidate to analyze a dataset and suggest further research based on the analysis. The written component will be in the form of a 7-day take-home exam; b) Oral Component: The student presents a paper written for publication in a conference or journal OR the oral examination is based on the student's take-home examination. The examination committee can pass, fail, or request re-examination of either the written or oral component. The committeeâ€™s composition and completion of the evaluation process should be submitted to the Ph.D. Program Director for approval no later than the end of the fifth semester. Students have two chances to pass the qualifying exam and the second date has to be within 90 days from the publication of the first exam result.

However, these digital signal processing techniques will be supplemented by analog signal processing techniques will be supplemented by analog signal processing techniques, which continue to be important for front-ends of receivers (and will remain important as carrier frequencies continue to migrate to higher frequencies). In addition to covering the mathematical principles of digital and analog signal processing, the course will cover contemporary digital signal processors.

Since many wireless systems involve connections among hardware developed by different commercial manufacturers, national and international standards play a major role in the evolution of wireless systems. Earlier first generation systems evolved to todayâ€™s second generation systems, with third generation systems expected shortly. One component of this course relates to these important standards. There are several fundamentally different wireless systems applications simultaneously evolving. Some relate to personal communications services (e.g., cellular telephony, wireless modems, etc.). Others relate to LANs, implemented in wireless rather than wired technologies to allow mobility or ease of access but providing data rates competitive with wired systems. Satellite communications systems (e.g., the Iridium system) are emerging and promise to provide a particularly interesting means of extending communication services. GPS systems provide an important means of determining oneâ€™s position to high accuracy. Digital and software radios exploit the familiar concept of radio transmissions to provide digital information (and draw upon channel assignment schemes related to the radio metaphor). In addition to the commercial development of separate (and non-integrated) wireless systems of the various types above, there are important military applications in which the various systems are integrated to provide a versatile communications systems designed for battlefield applications. Upon completion of this course, the student will have depth of understanding in the high-level, systems-oriented view of wireless systems.",

In addition, systems are said to be complex when emergent behavior is not resulting from a central control, when they display chaotic characteristics, and when the systems have more frequent occurrences of rare events, especially when initial conditions vary. This course will study and model complex and adaptive (as well as non- adaptive) systems, and will present and discuss the characteristics of complex and chaotic systems.",

The process leverages systems thinking - the antithesis of scientific reductionism, which fails to appreciate the interrelationships between components that make-up a system. Systems thinking has proven to be successful in the delivery of integrated technology products, and is now being applied to understanding the structure and dynamics of organizations for which communications and co-stuff in general is a key to business success; in other words inter-relationships are prime in managing an enterprise. The systems approach further emphasizes emergence, wider systems and the environment. These concepts are crucial to architecting an enterprise in consideration of issues of decentralization, alliance advantage, and market phenomena.",

The artists and designers of these movements responded to contemporary political and social upheavals with utopian projects intended to inform lived social existence. The course investigates whether it is possible to found imagined societies with advanced design, visual arts, and architecture. Topics include: the notion of utopian societies, the relation between social change and design and urban planning, and the idea of the artist as engineer and founder of progressive societies.",

Internship requires a plan (prepared with the job supervisor) to be presented to the Internship faculty sponsor, per approval, in the Program in Art & Technology, outlining the scope of work before starting the internship. It is expected that Internship will run approximately 8 to 12 hours per week for 14 weeks (or 112 to 168 hours per academic session) per 3 credits. A scheduled bi-weekly meeting with a group to discuss internships and career interests is expected. The studentâ€™s internship performance will be evaluated by the following: a) a weekly journal describing the studentâ€™s involvement in various activities and projects; b) an approximately five-page reflective essay in which the student integrates prior coursework with the internship experience (a theory and practice exercise); c) a basic report indicating the extent to which scope of work was accomplished; d) attendance and participation in group meetings; e) a written evaluation from the studentâ€™s supervisor; f) a portfolio of work accomplished during the internship, if appropriate.

At the same time, this course will introduce the difficulty of writing the history of photography as a separate discipline that operates both inside and outside histories of modern art.",

By sampling a wide array of works, notably films and literary texts, the course aims to destabilize normative sexual expectations while considering the consequences of social constructions to which individuals are conventionally subjected. Although the course focuses primarily on gay history, parallels to, and intersections with, issues of importance elsewhere in the GLBTQ community are indicated in lectures.",

This course traces the intrigues of civil and familial power as captured in significant literary works which offer profound statements, creatively wrought, about vital moral, social and political principles concentrating on works up to the Renaissance. Questions such as whether civilizations can expect their leaders to be ethical in addition to powerful or what happens to society when leaders confront evolving social conditions such as wars, civil unrest or new legal systems or what interplay there may be among the leader (often a man), his family, and the led will be examined in a variety of genres, such as tragedy and epic, and can be explored by invoking the moral imagination. By considering these questions through the vehicle of fiction, literature elicits not only the audience or readersâ€™ intellect, but their emotions as well â€“ in both cases, by means of reader-response. One pressing question we will tackle is whether fiction that engages issues of power and politics does â€“ or can function to â€“ change the world.",

Rather, it focuses on important core works in the genres of symphonic, chamber, and choral and solo vocal music, primarily from the common practice period extending from the late Renaissance to the late Romantic period, without excluding important trends and developments in earlier (medieval) and later (modern, post- modern) periods. The aim throughout is to focus on works that an interested music lover is liable to hear in live performance, and that form a basis for further musical exploration. At the same time, the course provides, without losing this central focus, at least brief exposure and consideration of selected examples of both world music and commercial pop music in some of its various forms. Finally, and unique to the Music and Technology program at Stevens, the course draws special attention, wherever appropriate, to important milestones in the development of music technology and their impact on the development of musical style.",

    "description": "This class concerns problems related to the ideas of good and evil. In the history of philosophy, no consensus has been reached as to how these ideas can be defined or explained. This is especially so for the idea of evil. It is unclear whether evil is a phenomenon in its own right or a mere reduction of the good. Also, it is unclear how the reality of evil can be reconciled with the idea of the supreme goodness of God. The problem of good and evil raises the questions of human nature, the existence of free will, and humansâ€™ basic attitude toward suffering. In modernity, the problem of evil was given further emphasis through the advent of nihilism, for which no moral obligations exist, and the mass extinction carried out by totalitarian regimes. The class will discuss classical and modern texts.",

Can evolutionary theory give us any insight into the nature of human consciousness? What does it mean for an evolutionary biologist to say that our heart is supposed to pump blood? What defines a biological species? Are human races biologically real? How does evolutionary theory, and contemporary human biology more generally, impact classical ethical theory?",

    "description": "This course introduces students to the study of gender from a sociological perspective. It focuses on gender as a social construction that occurs during interaction and influences our social relationships as well as personal experiences. We examine how gender and power are interrelated. To address these questions, we will, first of all, investigate theories and studies that explain gender differences from biological and cultural perspectives. then, we will analyze how gender shapes and is shaped by large social institutions such as education, the workplace, the family, politics, and media. In this course, we will also explore the intersections of gender, race, class and sexual orientation. The readings, class discussions, and assignments are designed to help students improve their critical thinking skills, understand the social construction of gender, learn about sociological research, and develop their communication skills.",

The course is a natural follow-up to time series modeling or introductory stochastic processes courses in that it expands on the notions of stationarity and ergodicity, auto-correlation, and the Markov property. The first part of the course focuses on spatial data, highlighting the generalization to the Euclidean plane from a onedimensional indexing typical of time series. The second part of the course deals with spatiotemporal data, emphasizing how concepts can then be extended further to indexing of higher dimensions. The course balances the mathematical study of the properties of models with the computational aspects involved in their implementation and the interpretation of real-life data examples, the latter relying on the statistical software and environment R.",

Analytical solutions of PDEs are available only in some simple cases, and for almost any real-life problem, PDEs can be solved only approximately by numerical methods. This course introduces the widely used finite difference and finite element methods and discusses conditions under which the numerical schemes are stable and converge to the true solutions of the PDEs; the latter is critical for understanding when the predictions from the approximations obtained by the numerical methods can be trusted.

TDA-based algorithms have been successfully used for tasks such as identifying new cancer types, detecting warning signals for imminent financial market crashes, and optimizing materials for methane capture. As a generalization of graphs, simplical complexes formed from data are used for recognizing topological properties algorithmically and are introduced with natural motivating examples from areas such as neuroscience and multi-agent decision tasks. With this in mind, we turn to algebraic topology, specifically simplicial homology, and then follow the development and implementation of persistent homology. Common challenges in data science, such as clustering and dimension reduction, are repeated themes and appear naturally in the Mapper algorithm. Examples of applications are given throughout the course, with coding mostly in Python. Prerequisites: Undergraduate linear algebra, basic familiarity with Python, Matlab or R",

Biofeedback is used in rehabilitation and in other movement-training paradigms to facilitate motor (re-)learning â€“ conveying biological sensor data to the end-user either concurrently (real-time) or terminally, after the movement is complete. For example, one emerging type of real-time biofeedback uses precise musical cues to convey biomechanics metrics to help people learn movement skills. Students will work in groups to design and experimentally evaluate an audio and/or visual biofeedback device of their choosing, as they develop skills using biomechanical sensors through lab assignments and communicate their device development in an IEEE-style paper. An additional unique aspect of the course is its community engagement: students will share their designs with younger students and/or the public, which will build studentsâ€™ abilities to present and teach new concepts.",

Energy is used as a unifying theme throughout the course to explain engineering properties such as melting temperature, thermal expansion, diffusivity, fracture, and creep. Instead of addressing polymers, metals, and ceramics separately, this course uses an integrated approach to discussing engineering properties of these materials under the same scenarios. For example, fracture of metals, ceramics and polymers is discussed together to show the similarities and differences in behaviors and causes. Topics covered also include phase diagrams (e.g., SMA), mechanical properties, viscoelastic behavior, functional materials, composites, and fatigue. Materials selection and cost analysis discussed is useful for engineers to choose appropriate materials for their engineering designs.",

The objective of this course is to help students understand how decisions are made, why they are often less than optimal, and how decision-making can be improved. This course will contrast how managers do make decisions with how they should make decisions, by thinking about how \"rational\" decision makers should act, by conducting in-class exercises and examining empirical evidence of how individuals do act (often erroneously) in managerial situations. The course will include statistical tools for decision-making, as well as treatment of the psychological factors involved in making decisions.",

Data analysis assignments will be given from real observational data (listed as â€™Labâ€™ in the syllabus). A set of semester-long group projects in astro-photography will give students a hands-on experience in imaging astronomical phenomena using everyday digital cameras(listed as â€™Projectâ€™ in the syllabus). The course will include an evening demonstration on campus and a visit to the planetarium. In terms of general education, astronomy will be used as a vehicle to introduce the essentials of model-building, justified simplifications, physical reasoning and self- correcting nature of scientific method.",

To this end, the students will need to understand how many of the most common stock models are created and utilized. At the core of this is understanding Brownian motion and other adapted stochastic processes from a conceptual level, which requires the knowledge of quadratic variation, martingales, and filtrations. Using these building blocks, many different structures of stock and interest rate processes can be developed: geometric Brownian motion, stochastic volatility models, Cox-Ingersoll-Ross, and Vasicek to name a few. After this course, the students will be able to price simple derivatives based on some of these models. In addition, through the use of stochastic integration, students will have a better understanding of portfolio valuation. By the end of this course, the student will be able to derive in its entirety the Black-Scholes-Merton European option pricing formula for Geometric Brownian Motion.",

    "name": "Risk Management for Capital Markets",
    "description": "Risk Control and derivative pricing are major concerns for financial institutions. Yet, as recent events have shown us there is a real need for adequate statistical tools to measure and anticipate the amplitude of the potential moves of the financial market. Many of the standard models seen on Wall Street however are based on simplified assumptions and can lead to systematic (and sometimes dramatic) underestimation of real risks. Starting from a detailed analysis of market data, one can take into account more faithfully the real behavior of financial markets (in particular the rare events) for asset allocation, derivative pricing and hedging, and risk control. This course will introduce some concepts to better address these issues. There will also be a few sessions in the Hanlon lab learning to use a Bloomberg terminal. Various financial instruments will be presented in a form familiar to Wall Street traders (i.e. Bloomberg screens). The purpose of Risk Management is to provide a valuation of these financial contracts (\"pricing\") and to provide various measures of risk and methods to hedge these risks as best as possible (\"hedging\"). These tasks are not just performed by Risk Managers but by \"Traders\" who price and hedge their respective trading books on a daily basis. Successful trading (over extended periods of time) comes down to successful risk management. Successful risk management comes down to robust valuation which is the main prerogative of Financial Engineering. Valuation of financial instruments begins with an analysis of possible future events (i.e. stock price moves, interest rate moves, defaults, etc.). Dealing with the future involves the mathematics of statistics and probability. The first step is to find a probability distribution that is suitable for the financial instrument at hand. The next step is to calibrate this distribution. The third step is to generate future events using this calibrated distribution and based on this, provide the necessary valuation and risk measures for the financial contract at hand. The failure of any of these steps can lead to incorrect valuation and therefore an incorrect assessment of the risks of the financial instrument under consideration.",
