    "description": "Many major medical device design practices have been established or changed as a result of an event or group of events. This course examines current practices and their relationship to events which shaped them, providing rationale and historical context for these practices. Spanning the past century, this course begins by examining events which shaped early medical device regulations and standards. It describes the ramifications of those events and how guidelines and rules for medical device design were formulated or changed as a result. It then reviews unique considerations in current medical device design practices, including regulatory, research and reimbursement practices and special challenges in clinical use. Medical devices that were marketed but resulted in poor outcomes or with technical flaws are studied to illustrate general themes among goals and needs for improved medical device design practices in the future. Aiming to expose students to broadly relevant and current issues, in its entirety, this course reviews the top causes of death, the most expensive diseases and illnesses, and current performance issues with common medical devices. Each lesson summarizes at least one critical element of design strategy for medical devices. Selected examples represent common medical device design challenges. This course is geared toward students seeking or recently entering a career in medical devices. In many cases, medical device practices were based upon practices established for drug regulation, and so relevant pharmaceutical industry developments are also presented, making this course interesting and pertinent to a student pursuing a career in the pharmaceutical field as well. It is also strongly applicable to those pursuing careers involving technology in clinical settings, including hospitals, and in pre-clinical/clinical research. The material that is presented includes highlights from several hundred references. Most of the references are publicly available. Students are encouraged to review the references in their entirety if they want to know more about a topic. Recognizing the multi-disciplinary nature of this field, the course is suitable for a student in any engineering and science program.",

Importantly, this course also covers the cause and mechanism of action for cellular signal pathways that become dysregulated and cause a variety of diseases including cancer, allergy/inflammation, hypertension, and metabolic disease like diabetes. Concordant with learning about the causes of diseases will be discussions of drug development, and state-of-the-art enzyme/cell-based assays for monitoring the inhibition/activation of protein targets. Pathways explored include: GPCR, Protein Kinases, lipid mediators such as leukotrienes a mediator of asthma, secondary messengers such as calcium and cAMP, nuclear receptors, transcription factors, apoptosis and selected immune responses.",

Especially the role of mechanics remains understudied despite several relevant applications, including brain growth and folding during development, traumatic brain injury, surgical intervention, and structural changes associated with aging and neurodegenerative diseases. In this course, fundamental concepts of mechanics such as continuum mechanics, viscoelasticity, growth, buckling, and mechanical experimentation will be used to understand the relation between brain function and form in health and disease. Students will be exposed to advanced concepts of the physiology and mechanical assessment of the nervous system. Learning materials will include lecture presentations, literature reviews, experimental data, and homework assignments. The course will conclude with a final project that may be a literature review, experimental study, or computational study and includes a project report.",

It progresses through the works of Eiffel, Roebling, Freyssinet, and Maillart to modern day innovators like Menn, Khan, and Calatrava. Students learn engineering concepts through technical presentations on structural landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, Guggenheim Museum, George Washington Bridge, and the Hearst Tower. The course studies beautiful works of structural art and takes site visits in the metropolitan area to supplement the classroom material. These trips will include the Brooklyn Bridge, Skyscraper Museum, Cast Iron District, Flatiron Building, Guggenheim Museum, and Hearst Building. The course converges engineering, architecture, design, and art into one distinguished field. It teaches the concepts and designs behind structural engineering, so high a quality in imaginative conception and execution, that the engineering itself takes on the aspects of art.",

There are two important aspects that have to be taken into account for a machine learning problem: how can we develop computationally efficient algorithms to learn useful information, and what is the prediction performance of the algorithm on unseen data. More importantly, is it possible to achieve the best of the two worlds, or there has to be some trade-off. This course will introduce students to concepts relating the computational efficiency and the statistical accuracy for a broad range of problems, including regression, classification, clustering, adaptive learning, to name a few. It will cover popular numerical methods that carry out state-of-the-art performance on the computational side, and it will also discuss possible improvement in the price of estimation accuracy and memory usage. The goal of the course is to help students understand these trade-offs from a theoretical perspective and guide them to design near-optimal algorithms for real-world problems.",

Furthermore, many conditions need to be fulfilled as directed by the International Student and Scholar Services (ISSS). In particular, students must remain in good standing throughout the practicum; prior approval of the graduate program coordinator, in consultation with the student’s academic advisor, is required for enrollment; the student must show evidence of a real commitment from a specific employer for a specific project, with preferably a detailed description of the project and job responsibilities. All these materials, including a job offer letter, must be provided to the program coordinator with sufficient advance notice so that the program coordinator has time to review the materials and determine if the project is appropriate. During the semester, the student must submit written monthly progress reports. At the end of the semester, the student must submit for grading a written report that describes their activities, even if the project is ongoing. The student must also present their activities in an accompanying oral presentation that is also graded. This is a one-credit course that may be repeated up to a total of three credits.",

The written component will be in the form of a 7-day take-home exam; b) Oral Component: The student presents a paper written for publication in a conference or journal OR the oral examination is based on the student's take-home examination. The examination committee can pass, fail, or request re-examination of either the written or oral component. The committee’s composition and completion of the evaluation process should be submitted to the Ph.D. Program Director for approval no later than the end of the fifth semester.

Digital signal processing techniques will be given particular emphasis, recognizing their considerable influence on present and emerging designs. However, these digital signal processing techniques will be supplemented by analog signal processing techniques will be supplemented by analog signal processing techniques, which continue to be important for front-ends of receivers (and will remain important as carrier frequencies continue to migrate to higher frequencies). In addition to covering the mathematical principles of digital and analog signal processing, the course will cover contemporary digital signal processors. The data processing issue arises in the coding of data for improved communications performance. Compression algorithms, reducing the amount of data that must be transmitted, coding techniques to provide error detection/protection, and encryption techniques to improve security are representative examples of data processing.",

Since many wireless systems involve connections among hardware developed by different commercial manufacturers, national and international standards play a major role in the evolution of wireless systems. Earlier first generation systems evolved to today’s second generation systems, with third generation systems expected shortly. One component of this course relates to these important standards. There are several fundamentally different wireless systems applications simultaneously evolving. Some relate to personal communications services (e.g., cellular telephony, wireless modems, etc.). Others relate to LANs, implemented in wireless rather than wired technologies to allow mobility or ease of access but providing data rates competitive with wired systems. Satellite communications systems (e.g., the Iridium system) are emerging and promise to provide a particularly interesting means of extending communication services. GPS systems provide an important means of determining one’s position to high accuracy. Digital and software radios exploit the familiar concept of radio transmissions to provide digital information (and draw upon channel assignment schemes related to the radio metaphor). In addition to the commercial development of separate (and non-integrated) wireless systems of the various types above, there are important military applications in which the various systems are integrated to provide a versatile communications systems designed for battlefield applications. Upon completion of this course, the student will have depth of understanding in the high-level, systems-oriented view of wireless systems.",

In addition, systems are said to be complex when emergent behavior is not resulting from a central control, when they display chaotic characteristics, and when the systems have more frequent occurrences of rare events, especially when initial conditions vary. This course will study and model complex and adaptive (as well as non- adaptive) systems, and will present and discuss the characteristics of complex and chaotic systems.",

The objective of this course is to help students understand how decisions are made, why they are often less than optimal, and how decision-making can be improved. This course will contrast how managers do make decisions with how they should make decisions, by thinking about how \"rational\" decision makers should act, by conducting in-class exercises and examining empirical evidence of how individuals do act (often erroneously) in managerial situations. The course will include statistical tools for decision-making, as well as treatment of the psychological factors involved in making decisions.",

The artists and designers of these movements responded to contemporary political and social upheavals with utopian projects intended to inform lived social existence. The course investigates whether it is possible to found imagined societies with advanced design, visual arts, and architecture. Topics include: the notion of utopian societies, the relation between social change and design and urban planning, and the idea of the artist as engineer and founder of progressive societies.",

A scheduled bi-weekly meeting with a group to discuss internships and career interests is expected. The student’s internship performance will be evaluated by the following: a) a weekly journal describing the student’s involvement in various activities and projects; b) an approximately five-page reflective essay in which the student integrates prior coursework with the internship experience (a theory and practice exercise); c) a basic report indicating the extent to which scope of work was accomplished; d) attendance and participation in group meetings; e) a written evaluation from the student’s supervisor; f) a portfolio of work accomplished during the internship, if appropriate.

By sampling a wide array of works, notably films and literary texts, the course aims to destabilize normative sexual expectations while considering the consequences of social constructions to which individuals are conventionally subjected.

This course traces the intrigues of civil and familial power as captured in significant literary works which offer profound statements, creatively wrought, about vital moral, social and political principles concentrating on works up to the Renaissance. Questions such as whether civilizations can expect their leaders to be ethical in addition to powerful or what happens to society when leaders confront evolving social conditions such as wars, civil unrest or new legal systems or what interplay there may be among the leader (often a man), his family, and the led will be examined in a variety of genres, such as tragedy and epic, and can be explored by invoking the moral imagination. By considering these questions through the vehicle of fiction, literature elicits not only the audience or readers’ intellect, but their emotions as well – in both cases, by means of reader-response. One pressing question we will tackle is whether fiction that engages issues of power and politics does – or can function to – change the world.",

Rather, it focuses on important core works in the genres of symphonic, chamber, and choral and solo vocal music, primarily from the common practice period extending from the late Renaissance to the late Romantic period, without excluding important trends and developments in earlier (medieval) and later (modern, post- modern) periods. The aim throughout is to focus on works that an interested music lover is liable to hear in live performance, and that form a basis for further musical exploration. At the same time, the course provides, without losing this central focus, at least brief exposure and consideration of selected examples of both world music and commercial pop music in some of its various forms. Finally, and unique to the Music and Technology program at Stevens, the course draws special attention, wherever appropriate, to important milestones in the development of music technology and their impact on the development of musical style.",

This is especially so for the idea of evil. It is unclear whether evil is a phenomenon in its own right or a mere reduction of the good. Also, it is unclear how the reality of evil can be reconciled with the idea of the supreme goodness of God. The problem of good and evil raises the questions of human nature, the existence of free will, and humans’ basic attitude toward suffering. In modernity, the problem of evil was given further emphasis through the advent of nihilism, for which no moral obligations exist, and the mass extinction carried out by totalitarian regimes. The class will discuss classical and modern texts.",

We will examine the value questions that arise in relations among nation-states in such contexts as human rights, distributive justice, economic development, and the preservation of the environment. Among the topics to be discussed are just war theory and the analysis and response to terrorism; hunger, welfare, and global distributive justice; immigration and refugees; international business ethics; racism and sexism in national and international contexts; and democracy and the Internet. To illuminate these issues, we will consider alternative contemporary perspectives in political philosophy, including liberal, communitarian, and feminist approaches, and will examine their implications for politics in the context of emerging global frameworks.",

Under suitable conditions these formats allow a stable representation and a reduction of the data size from exponential complexity (with respect to the dimension of the space) to a linear complexity, which kills the curse of dimensionality. Another goal of the course is to present variety of relatively novel unsupervised machine learning methods using matrix and tensor decompositions, as latent variable analysis based on (1) statistical independence and (2) sparsity assumptions, kernel and generalized principal component analysis, and non-negative tensor decomposition, all of which reveal hidden patterns in the data.",

They relate physical characteristics, e.g., fluid velocity, displacement, temperature, etc., and their derivatives as functions of time and space. Analytical solutions of PDEs are available only in some simple cases, and for almost any real-life problem, PDEs can be solved only approximately by numerical methods. This course introduces the widely used finite difference and finite element methods and discusses conditions under which the numerical schemes are stable and converge to the true solutions of the PDEs; the latter is critical for understanding when the predictions from the approximations obtained by the numerical methods can be trusted. The course also offers projects, where the students can implement the finite difference and finite element methods for proposed problems.

TDA-based algorithms have been successfully used for tasks such as identifying new cancer types, detecting warning signals for imminent financial market crashes, and optimizing materials for methane capture. As a generalization of graphs, simplical complexes formed from data are used for recognizing topological properties algorithmically and are introduced with natural motivating examples from areas such as neuroscience and multi-agent decision tasks. With this in mind, we turn to algebraic topology, specifically simplicial homology, and then follow the development and implementation of persistent homology. Common challenges in data science, such as clustering and dimension reduction, are repeated themes and appear naturally in the Mapper algorithm. Examples of applications are given throughout the course, with coding mostly in Python. Prerequisites: Undergraduate linear algebra, basic familiarity with Python, Matlab or R",

    "description": "Many major medical device design practices have been established or changed as a result of an event or group of events. This course examines current practices and their relationship to events which shaped them, providing rationale and historical context for these practices. Spanning the past century, this course begins by examining events which shaped early medical device regulations and standards. It describes the ramifications of those events and how guidelines and rules for medical device design were formulated or changed as a result. It then reviews unique considerations in current medical device design practices, including regulatory, research and reimbursement practices and special challenges in clinical use. Medical devices that were marketed but resulted in poor outcomes or with technical flaws are studied to illustrate general themes among goals and needs for improved medical device design practices in the future. Aiming to expose students to broadly relevant and current issues, in its entirety, this course reviews the top causes of death, the most expensive diseases and illnesses, and current performance issues with common medical devices. Each lesson summarizes at least one critical element of design strategy for medical devices. Selected examples represent common medical device design challenges. This course is geared toward students seeking or recently entering a career in medical devices. In many cases, medical device practices were based upon practices established for drug regulation, and so relevant pharmaceutical industry developments are also presented, making this course interesting and pertinent to a student pursuing a career in the pharmaceutical field as well. It is also strongly applicable to those pursuing careers involving technology in clinical settings, including hospitals, and in pre-clinical/clinical research. The material that is presented includes highlights from several hundred references. Most of the references are publicly available. Students are encouraged to review the references in their entirety if they want to know more about a topic. Recognizing the multi-disciplinary nature of this field, the course is suitable for a student in any engineering and science program.",

Biofeedback is used in rehabilitation and in other movement-training paradigms to facilitate motor (re-)learning – conveying biological sensor data to the end-user either concurrently (real-time) or terminally, after the movement is complete. For example, one emerging type of real-time biofeedback uses precise musical cues to convey biomechanics metrics to help people learn movement skills. Students will work in groups to design and experimentally evaluate an audio and/or visual biofeedback device of their choosing, as they develop skills using biomechanical sensors through lab assignments and communicate their device development in an IEEE-style paper. An additional unique aspect of the course is its community engagement: students will share their designs with younger students and/or the public, which will build students’ abilities to present and teach new concepts.",

Such scientific basis consists of atom arrangements, defects, temperature effect on atom arrangements, entropy, and Gibbs free energy. Energy is used as a unifying theme throughout the course to explain engineering properties such as melting temperature, thermal expansion, diffusivity, fracture, and creep. Instead of addressing polymers, metals, and ceramics separately, this course uses an integrated approach to discussing engineering properties of these materials under the same scenarios. For example, fracture of metals, ceramics and polymers is discussed together to show the similarities and differences in behaviors and causes. Topics covered also include phase diagrams (e.g., SMA), mechanical properties, viscoelastic behavior, functional materials, composites, and fatigue. Materials selection and cost analysis discussed is useful for engineers to choose appropriate materials for their engineering designs.",

The goal is to create a stable, resilient shoreline that enhances the natural ecosystem. This course is designed to fit an industry need for engineers that are familiar with traditional coastal engineering concepts as well as ecology and/or bioengineering. This will be accomplished through lectures focused on the characteristics of natural organisms (flora and fauna) that contribute to the stability and ecological enhancement of traditional coastal structures. Some of the topics to be presented in this class include evaluating site conditions, integrating ecological considerations with engineering requirements, determining representative costs and understanding project regulations. A significant portion of the class will be dedicated to developing designs for living shorelines projects in New York and New Jersey. Special topics will be addressed through guest lectures and field trips.",

Approximate methods such as the Hartree-Fock and Density functional methods have been used but calculating the atomization energy of compounds accurately can take days using conventional techniques. Machine learning approaches to these problems have begun to show substantial improvement over traditional methods with respect to accuracy and efficiency. In other areas such as particle physics, where large amounts of collision data need to be analyzed rapidly and accurately, supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques have shown initial success. This is not only defined by the extremely successful running and analysis of Large Hadron Collider (LHC) data, but also by the availability of cosmological and astrophysical observations. Another aspect is the use of quantum systems to enhance the speed and power of traditionally slow machine learning techniques leading to the new exciting field of quantum machine learning. Both the use of classical machine learning applied to the analysis of quantum physics and the application of quantum systems to enhance classical machine learning algorithms will be discussed. Standard machine learning methods along with the basics of quantum information will be reviewed.",

PSM systems are comprehensive sets of policies, procedures and practices designed to ensure that barriers to major incidents are in place, in use and effective. The objectives of this course are to: define PSM and why it is important, describe each of the 12 elements and their applicability, identify process safety responsibilities, give real examples and practical applications to help better understand each element, share experiences and lessons learned of all participants, and assess the quality and identify enhancements to student’s site PSM program.",

In order for students to be able to price derivatives, they must first understand the behavior of the underlying. To this end, the students will need to understand how many of the most common stock models are created and utilized. At the core of this is understanding Brownian motion and other adapted stochastic processes from a conceptual level, which requires the knowledge of quadratic variation, martingales, and filtrations. Using these building blocks, many different structures of stock and interest rate processes can be developed: geometric Brownian motion, stochastic volatility models, Cox-Ingersoll-Ross, and Vasicek to name a few. After this course, the students will be able to price simple derivatives based on some of these models. In addition, through the use of stochastic integration, students will have a better understanding of portfolio valuation. By the end of this course, the student will be able to derive in its entirety the Black-Scholes-Merton European option pricing formula for Geometric Brownian Motion.",

    "name": "Risk Management for Capital Markets",
    "description": "Risk Control and derivative pricing are major concerns for financial institutions. Yet, as recent events have shown us there is a real need for adequate statistical tools to measure and anticipate the amplitude of the potential moves of the financial market. Many of the standard models seen on Wall Street however are based on simplified assumptions and can lead to systematic (and sometimes dramatic) underestimation of real risks. Starting from a detailed analysis of market data, one can take into account more faithfully the real behavior of financial markets (in particular the rare events) for asset allocation, derivative pricing and hedging, and risk control. This course will introduce some concepts to better address these issues. There will also be a few sessions in the Hanlon lab learning to use a Bloomberg terminal. Various financial instruments will be presented in a form familiar to Wall Street traders (i.e. Bloomberg screens). The purpose of Risk Management is to provide a valuation of these financial contracts (\"pricing\") and to provide various measures of risk and methods to hedge these risks as best as possible (\"hedging\"). These tasks are not just performed by Risk Managers but by \"Traders\" who price and hedge their respective trading books on a daily basis. Successful trading (over extended periods of time) comes down to successful risk management. Successful risk management comes down to robust valuation which is the main prerogative of Financial Engineering. Valuation of financial instruments begins with an analysis of possible future events (i.e. stock price moves, interest rate moves, defaults, etc.). Dealing with the future involves the mathematics of statistics and probability. The first step is to find a probability distribution that is suitable for the financial instrument at hand. The next step is to calibrate this distribution. The third step is to generate future events using this calibrated distribution and based on this, provide the necessary valuation and risk measures for the financial contract at hand. The failure of any of these steps can lead to incorrect valuation and therefore an incorrect assessment of the risks of the financial instrument under consideration.",

This course builds on Course 2 using a metaphor where the students plan on a successful product launch, using our project to work through continuous integration and test and ultimately bringing a robust solution to life in the form of a working CPS system. We intersperse lectures with individual and group project based activities to ensure that the developed system is functional and robust. We discuss and use the most effective techniques for fault and failure tolerance, analysis, and testing method and principles. We plan to capitalize on simulation and physical systems resources for continuous and automated testing and discuss the balance of testing versus analysis. The students will continuously collect evidence of quality, performance measures and traceability information.",

Analysis, design and governance and design of such systems can be very challenging and require rigorous agent-based thinking rooted in analytical models. This course teaches fundamentals of multi-agent systems, starting from models of single agent decision making and planning under uncertainty, and moves to basic frameworks for multi-agent system analysis tools, with a focus on game theory and complex network analysis . The course will take a combination of analytical and conceptual methods, and will use agent- based simulation techniques rooted in these methods. Students will apply the course material to a real-world project, close to their area of dissertation research.",

Uniquely, the class shows how it is possible to use systems in order to think more deeply and to act more decisively. This approach is made possible by emphasizing the simultaneity of perspectives, the role of paradox, and the centrality of soft issues in resolving complexity. The SystemitoolTM is used to structure and conduct analysis of decisions. This class is aimed at policy and decision-makers at all levels in an organization.",

    "description": "Broadband Service Management is a comprehensive course for those interested in deploying and operating broadband networks from a technical and managerial aspect. A broadband networks success is based on its ability to deliver a desired service with a specific service requirement referred to as a Service Level Agreement (SLA). The Service Level Management whether it is with an operator, infrastructure vendor, Third Party Vendor (3PV) or customer all have specific Key Performance Indicators (KPI) associated with them. The ability to define, identify, and manage those Key Performance Indicators associated with a broadband network Service Level Agreement requires a thorough understanding of the entire broadband ecosystem. The course will present key topics and criteria required to implement and sustain a network. Emphasis will be placed on the ability to define performance quantities and manage the network balancing business risks while minimizing costs to meet the objectives of the broadband network.",
