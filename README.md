Class query Discord bot for Stevens Institute of Technology. 

Supply your Discord bot token as the DISCORD_TOKEN environment variable. 

Caches responses and classes in ./cache on startup if they are are not already present. 

If you must delete the cache, startup will take some time to query all the courses since the requests are asynchronous but sequential. 

Pull requests welcome.
